       " 'this post is partially out of boredom looking for something to talk about lol so i’ve been personally using a v2 smartthings hub for probably about 45 years whenever the v2 hub came out that’s when i started using it and i’ve been relatively happy with very little issues but i’ve only ever used my hub in a small apartment and now in a small house i realize that for zigbee other wall powered devices can serve as a repeater to build the mesh network so that plays a big factor as well the point of the post ismy dad owns a restaurant it’s been in our family since the 60’s he likes to do things the old way and that’s fine but there are certain things i think would make his life a little easier if i were to help introduce him to some smart devices some exampleshe’s constantly calling in to make sure his walk in table fridges are within the safe temperature range he also has a problem with the employees forgetting to turn on the open sign and some times other things like the jukebox video games etc i was thinking maybe i could buy him a smartthings hub and get some sensors smart outletsbulbs and such set up for him how many of you are using smartthings for your business and would you recommend it i think it would be a fun project for me but i don’t want to create a headache for my dad with my home setup it’s usually a work in progressoccasionally bulbs disconnect batteries need to be replaced at least yearly etc so i don’t know if i want this so i can help my dad or if i’m biased because i would be excited to set this up for him curious of your thoughts',\n",
       " 'hi i have a coffee grinder that my employees are sometimes leaving on after they use it as it’s an expensive piece of equipment and runs fairly silent with no lights i need to make sure it turns off i have it hooked up to a smartthings outlet with a power monitor there are 2 devices i have on this switch one of them constantly draws 58 watts and the grinder pulls around 140 watts when on 0 when off i am trying to find a way to shut it off if the power usage is above a certain level for x number of minutes the power switch on the grinder is a momentary switch so if the power is shut off on the outlet it will stay shut off if the switch is powered back on so it’d be nice if i could just power cycle the switch instead of another routine to turn the switch back on any suggestions tiathanks i spent around 10 minutes trying to figure out webcore the installation instructions aren’t correct as there is no settings button to add the repository but i probably just need to poke around a bit morerontalley if power stays below 60 watts for 2 minutes then using outlet turn off wait 10 seconds turn on hi thanks for this information i got webcore up and running the script is working but the problem is either polling or reporting the script does not run unless i refresh the power outlet and it shows the current power consumption from what i’ve read the power outlet should only report a change in the power usage how do i get this to refresh so that the script will run this outlet is the iris zwave outlet square model i got at lowes scriptpng1178×563 523 kbthanks using stay and the code looks a lot cleaner now but still the same problem the device is not reporting the power change so it doesn’t work unless i refresh the outlet from within the smartthings app the outlet is model 3210l looking at the event logs in the api it only reports the power usage when i refresh the device i am starting to think this is a limitation of the outlet so hoping there’s a way to either pollautomate refreshing or enable it to send status changesok i found the issue the device handler was smartpower outlet in the api current states only showed switch and power so i changed it to smartpower outlet v1 which doesn’t have the power feature so then i switched it back to smartpower outlet then i saw i had gained an additional state which was checkinterval now the device reports the power soon after i turn the grinder on so the device handler seemed to be the issue not sure why switching it back and forth fixed it now this is working perfectly thank you so much everyone for your helpit’s been a while but this is my code below hope it helps image1178×529 256 kb',\n",

       " 'the fibaro fgk101 temperature doorwindow sensor goes on sale in the us this month 9084 mhz version fibaro.com fibaro explore the home automation system its time for smart living explore the home automation system that you havent seen before use google home amazon alexa or apple siri to communicate with your smart home at this time smartthings builtin support for fibaro fgk101 is fairly basic just openclosed but this zwave device offers much more than that temperature measurement tampering alarm and a set of configurable options afaik it is the smallest available zwave temperature sensor 76 x 17 x 19 mm 3 x 23 x 35 and a very accurate one the optional to92 ds18b20 sensor is 05°c accurate from –10°c to 85°c 14°f to 185°f according to the dallasmaxim ds18b20 datasheet http://pdf.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheet/maxim/ds18b20.pdf although still a work in progress the handler below supports periodic and threshold controlled temperature measurements antitampering alarm as well as openclosed sensing and it can be configured modifying some lines in the handler for different behaviors like reporting in °f instead of °c or changing the wakeup period from the default 60mn since it is my first attempt at a st handler i am pretty sure it is suboptimal but some of you may find it useful any comments or bug reports welcomed fibaro zwave fgk101 temperature doorwindow

http://www.fibaro.com/files/instrukcje/eng/doorwindowsensor%20fgk-101-107%20eng_v21-v23.pdf the current version of this handler is parameterized to force devices wakeup on any openclosed state change

temperature is natively reported by sensor in celsius sensormultilevelreportscale0 convertion is needed for fahrenheit display a few specificities of this device that are relevant to better understand some parts of this handler it is a battery operated device so commands can only be sent to it whenever it wakes up it is a multichannel device and the multilevel temperature sensor reports only from endpoint2 specific configurable parameters are documented in the above operating manual some of those parameters must be modified to activate the antitampering alarm some of the scaffolding has been left in place as comments since it may help other people to understandmodify this handler beware the optional ds18b20 sensor must be connected before the device is activated otherwise reset the device important for debugging purpose it is much better to change the wakeup period from the default 60mn to 1mn or so but unless you force the early wake up of the sensor forcing openclosed for instance

testing showed the deltatemperature notification does not work properly but periodic temperature updates do will update the handler when it does edit 4102014 looks like my testing process was the guilty party and the handler works properly sorry for the false alertupdated my post to version 08 of my custom handler it has been working fine for more than 1 month on 6 different fgk101 sensors all comments welcomedhi matthew first i assume all your fibaro devices are the us version 9084 mhz otherwise they won’t work with the current smartthings hub some time in 2015 an international version may become available if so you should be able to join your fibaro device to your hub following the usual procedure the device needs to be recognized by the hub before you can use it with a custom handler second you need to create an account at https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ to access the ide environment and third when in the ide go to my device types new smartdevice create your own type and copypaste the code of my handler from the first post into your own type then save publish for me location yourlocation devices yourdevice when you look at my devices yourdevice its version should be self published to check your device is properly using the custom device handler push and release the antitampering switch at the bottom of the fibaro fgk101 it should display on your iphone or android equivalent a tampering alarm and a temperature update note that if you want to display temperatures in fahrenheits fibaro reports °c by default you need to perform a conversion and modify line 262 of the handler mapunit cmdscale 1 f c hope this helpsthe fibaro fgk101 user manual is there http://www.fibaro.com/files/instrukcje/eng/doorwindowsensor%20fgk-101-107%20eng_v21-v23.pdf the ds18b20 sensor is a to92 package that you need to buy as an option for a few and which takes about 2 mn to connect inside the fgk101 following the instructions in the user manual accuracy is 05°c absolute which means around 02°c over the usual temperatures rangefirst i confirm that a push on the antitampering contact at the bottom of fgk101 should force an immediate temperature update unfortunately the openclose magnet does not do it for some obscure zwave reason a few things you should check did you savepublish in your own st space a copy of my jj’s fibaro fgk101 handler before attempting the first pairing of your fgk101 just in case try a different ds18b20 out of 12 i bought on ebay 1 was defective furthermore i confirm your 3 leads connection is correct make sure your ds18b20 was properly mounted into the fgk101 and the battery connected before the fgk101 was first paired with your st hub if you did connect the fgk101 first without a ds18b20 you will have to remove the fgk101 from the hub zwave network reset it to factory settings see fgk101 notice and then pair it again what i find suspect is when you say the fibaro was recognized then i changed it to your device type if you followed the proper procedure above the st mobile dashboard should immediately recognize it as jj’s fibaro fgk101 handler type if the above is not enough to solve your problem you have to use the development environment at https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/devices and first check in my devices that yourfgk101physicaldevice has the proper attributes type jj’s fibaro fgk101 handler version selfpublished location yourlocation hub yourhub group none then go to my devices types and savepublish your copy of the jj’s fibaro fgk101 handler set location to yourlocation and install to yourfgk101physicaldevice then pressing the antitampering switch at the bottom of the fgk101 should force an immediate temperature update and print at the bottom of the window a long debugging trace hope this helps this same driver is currently running at my location with 13 fgk101 over 12 hubs and works fineysrgrathe this worked much better for my us fibaro than jj’s version i am just curious to know what did not work for you with my fgk101 custom driver mine has been working fine for more than a year for a dozen fgk101 us which does not say that i have not suffered plenty of problems due to the catastrophic instability of the smartthings clouddifficult to understand your problem with so little information obviously your device is properly paired with your hub and it uses the proper custom handler a few suggestions to try check the proper electrical connection of the optional ds18b20 sensor into the fgk101 the ds18b20 must be installed before pairing the fgk101 to the hub if it was installed after you need to unpair the fgk101 from your hub reset it according to the instructions within the fgk101 datasheet and then repair the fgk101 to your hub use list events all to check the fgk101 device activity at the minimum you should see a device wakeup every hour this same driver has been working fine for me with 11 fgk101 for more than 1 year note that the openclose status update is done only when there is some actual openclose activity use the magnet to check it works hope this helpsfirst i apologize for the faulty mention of a °c to °f conversion the way the device handler is coded the conversion is performed automatically based on the °f°c selection you did for your own location regarding the temperature update whenever you have a 516 03125°c 0562 °f temperature difference you should get a temperature event reported to the hub even when the temperature remains stable with less than 03125°c fluctuations you should get a temperature event every 4 hours based on the current states of your picture there is however something fishy in your copy of the jj’s fibaro fgk101 handler it lists only current states temperature battery when it should list temperature battery contact alarm reportasap it is probably related to the way you created your own copy of jj’s fibaro fgk101 handler if you check in the ide my device handlers capabilitiesright column you should see alarm battery configuration contact sensor sensor temperature measurement if you don’t you need to recreate your copy of jj’s fibaro fgk101 handler this time with the right

       " 'welcome to the world of housepanel a little over a year ago i introduced this thread by announcing the release of housepanel under the opendash brand since that time opendash and housepanel have not really helped each other much and i have drifted away from that branding so this introductory post has been edited and updated to reflect the current approach to distributing and supporting housepanel housepanel is a highly flexible locally hosted dashboard app for smartthings and hubitat everything you need to know about installing and using housepanel can be found at the new housepanel website at http://www.housepanel.net or here in this smartthings community thread all the files you will need to install are in the housepanel github found here github kewashihousepanel smartthings and hubitat smart home web app dashboard kewashihousepanel installation and customization instructions are on the housepanel website http://www.housepanel.net please note that prior notices have pointed users to the wiki in the old opendash github this wiki is no longer maintained up to date so you should use the new documentation good luck trying it out i hope you enjoy here are a few screen shots showing what housepanel looks like when installed and operational please note that these are just examples taken from my own home installation with housepanel you can make your dashboard look basically like whatever you want including using any background photo custom borders custom colors custom icons random placement and more kitchen panel notice the two presence tiles have my and my wife’s photos on them i did some fancy footwork in the built in tile editor to make a cool looking analog clock my pressure pad uses a custom icon the stereo and night mode buttons were altered to have no borders the thermostat ac setting was hidden because it is winter here imagepng1187×719 254 kb office panel notice the office plug tile that combines items from multiple things the computer speakers tile includes a web launcher to spotify added with the customizer finally the sonos tile shows how an icon can even be placed into the title barsort of the biggest difference is hp is considerably harder to set up in return it is free and it runs fully under your control it is more customizable and is presented as an open source platform by the way i bought actiontiles and i still use it sometimes so if you already have it and are happy with it there is no need to use hp i made it because my wife wanted something that looked a little less sterile and i wanted something that was more flexible i ended up having fun writing it so here it is my goal has since evolved to provide an open source platform that developers an use to creat dashboards and panels for smartthings this is why i am excited about the opendash merge and brand the above look is just one of many ways you can make housepanel look you can also use it as a silent web service for controlling or querying your smart home i will document how soonkewashi you can also use it as a silent web service for controlling or querying your smart home i will document how soon i realize that i already documented this feature in the alpha release thread the information posted there is still valid take a look announcing housepanel control panel alpha hi good people long time no post well i’m super excited to share with you all the following update to housepanel with the latest version you can now use housepanel as a generic endpoint to call from either python or eventghost both work equally well but python is more flexible of course to use first update your code from the housepanel main repository be sure to get both the front end housepanelphp file and the back end housepanelgroovy file they are in separate git repositories as a reminder the front end is here and the back end is here to use housepanel as an endpoint start by launching your browser and invoking http://yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=showid where yoururl should be replace by where you installed the housepanelphp web site this will retrieve a pa pretty cool eh for this to work as described above you will need to first authenticate your pc or mac by loading housepanel into a browser this will save the cookie in that browser so the above calls will work if you want to skip that step or use the endpoint feature from ghostscript which has its own internal browsercurl mechanism you will need to save your authentication information in your clientinfophp file the authentication info is displayed when you make the call to housepanel with useajaxshowid variableedit new check box added a new kiosk mode feature doc for how to use it is below from the wiki kiosk mode to run housepanel in kiosk mode first you will need to download a good kiosk mode browser i like the fully kiosk browser for android tablets for ios ipad tablets you will have to research other options you can also use safari to then put the page on the ios desktop to create a kiosk effect once you have that then turning on kiosk mode will remove the options button from the bottom of the options page on the options page select the check box to turn on kiosk mode be aware that once you turn kiosk mode on the only way to turn it back off is to force housepanel to display the options page again using the same method described above again this is wwwyourwebpagehousepanelphpuseajaxshowoptionslighty following looks good so far thanks just updated the wiki to document the api mode in my opinion this is one of the more exciting things about housepanel using it as an endpoint api i plan to write a bunch of python scripts to implement more sophisticated smart home logic than i can do with groovymassive speed increase implemented today by taking advantage of php session variables to save the slow part which is reading all things from the smartthings cloud for most situations the things people have do not change very often so the only time one needs to reload is when you add a device this means you will have to force a reload when that happens by closing the browser and restarting it i will also add a reload button for that in the future in the mean time i think everyone will enjoy the huge speedup that this change implements now when you go to the options page you can quickly see the effect of adding things to rooms etc and page reloads are a snap nowimportant bug fixes updated today includes fixing default kiosk mode to false also finally implemented fix of misaligned columns in the default options page on tablets added a filter option so you can pick which things to show and finally added sorting of things by category still can’t sort the whole list but can add that as an option later pretty easily fixed a few other bugs such as any added new thing will now show up in the page it would have using the default logicnitwit i will try to set this up over the next few days and will report back thanks installation is a bit of a slog but the wiki is fairly detailed let me know if you have any problems the hardest part is setting up the rpi with proper readwrite permissions rest is just like loading up any othe php web app regarding ip cameras i have 3 set up and working great as still photo sources you just have to configure them to save a photo once a minute somewhere on you rpi and then point to that url is your custom css file the wiki describes this i haven’t had any success setting up a live video stream apparently this isn’t easy nor reliable and each camera type does streaming a little differently it’s on my todo list to figure out finally once you get it set up you might try out the web service api feature this is quickly becoming my favorite part of housepanelhi folks thought i would post an example of how to use the housepanel api from a python script in this script we call the api using our access token and endpoint we read the thing id’s from the hmoptionscfg file and then we call the api to query the status of a few select things here is the code import json import urllibrequest def callapistr accesstoken yourdata endpt https://graph.api.smartthings.com:443/api/smartapps/installations/yourdata weburl http://myurl/housepanel/housepanel.php url weburl hmtoken accesstoken hmendpoint endpt useajaxdoqueryid str with urllibrequesturlopenurl as f responsestr freaddecodeutf8 return responsestr def getthings fp openhmoptionscfgr things jsonloadfp ids listthingsindexkeys idlist typelist for i in ids k ifind if k 0 typelistappendik idlistappendik1 return typelist idlist if name main mytypes myids getthings for i in rangelenmytypes printtype mytypesi id myidsi if mytypesicontact response callapimyidsi print mytypesi response when you run this python code it will print out the status of all contact things in your system note that you must replace the placeholder data above with your real data in the strings for hmtoken and hmendpoint these can be found by using the useajaxshowinfo feature notice that this script reads the id numbers from the hmoptionscfg file directly this simple example is just the tip of the iceberg it isn’t hard to imagine how you could write similar python scripts to do some amazing things with your smart homehi chris first thanks for trying out housepanel and providing this feedback you are almost there let me walk through each issue and offer some fixes on the extra tiles what happens is hp displays all attributes of each tile i styled the ones i have but you have some things that i don’t so the attributes are showin up you can fix this by inspecting the tiles and getting the names of the extra attribute then add the displaynone to your css file for these items for the weather tile you need to first add it to your smartthings account as a new device so that from the marketplacecwwilson08 4th upon initial loading of house panel or page refresh i noticed the clock doesnt display the correct time after a few minutes i have not sat and watched how long it takes it updates the clock to the correct time the clock updates once every 60 seconds to stay no sync with the real timei have the same issue and i’m working on a solution i think the problem is caused by using the punch through javascript addon that makes touch events work in jquery you only need this to drag icons around on the page so i am thinking about activating this only when the browser is not a mobile device will post this fix later tonight will also try swapping the logic on unknown tiles so that the default is displaynone for all but known things should fix lots of issuesthanks the touch issue is caused by the javascript library that i use to trick mobile devices into working with jquery i need to play with it to fix or implement a native touch feature that mimics the jquery click and drag feature an easy fix is to just disable the library on mobile devices and force users to use a desktop tablet drag icons around i like that option because most people probably do not want end users to be reconfiguring the page anyway i will work on this tonighthquotecwwilson08 post18

has been truncated show original it sounds like you have it set right the configuration process is slow and will take several minutes it’s best just to watch in the logs and don’t touch any buttons push the configure scenes button again and wait for it to complete before testing the scene controller dh can provide the following functions via smartthings it will provide 5 buttons with button pressed events that can be used to trigger events in st this functionality works with the smart lighting app it provides five attributes for indicators showing their current state on off applications can be triggered via a button press and then use the indicator attributes to determinecheck the current on off state this will work well with core and other apps that allow access to device handler attributes it provides commands to toggle or set the indicators these work with core and other apps that have access to commands there are 5 toggle commands that change the state of the associated indicator the indicatorset command requires two parameters indicator number 15 and on or off 1 or 0 it can be configured to control zwave devices directly via association the user must enter node ids and desired levelsstates in the preferences per instructions it can be configured to control zwave devices directly via scene commands for this to work the target devices must support the scene activation 0x2b command and they must be configured with the scene scene actuator conf 0x2c command separately check your device raw description for 2b and 2c a custom device handler is need to set these devices up see below for an example devices actuated via 4 and 5 above will continue to function without the smartthings hub online this is useful for applications where things are dedicated i have a controller at the nexus of the kitchen living and dining rooms right where the builder should have put a bank of switches but didn’t i would not want this to stop working if st or the internet stopped working i’ve tested this device handler with some linear dimmers scene controlled and some ge and zwave4less switches via association i’ve done some testing of the interaction with smartthings i see three modes of use available to the user a use the default config settings and use smartthings app like core to activate any other smartthings devices b use a sceneassociation configuration and let the controller send commands to devices c use a combination of a and b and let smartthings extend the controllers capabilities to nonzwave devices i’ve forked the device handler by snailium for

and let me know how it works i am new to programming this stuff and i know the code needs some cleaning up and likely bugs fixed so any help is appreciated there are a few limitations the 6th button on the controller is an all off button it is intentionally not supported as a separate button in the dh however it works as intended by the device designers it signals an off command for all other buttons that are on the indicators and button presses for the other five will report to st their status properly the device uses button hold to dim or brighten scene controlled zwave devices there is no support for st in the dh for button holds as i could not find a way to determine which button was held perhaps future support a better implementation would be a 5 switch parentchild dh the was beyond my skill set for programming currently perhaps it can be implemented in the future there is no support for remotely activating a button i could not find a way get the device to respond on any such commands the indicators can be turned off and on the button will respond appropriately when pressed following a remote change of the indicator pressing a button after turning the indicator off will turn on the scene pressing a button after turning the indicator on will turn off the scene while setting the indicators does not control devices it will be useful for setting the desired button state if your group of devices are turned off via st by other means then turn the indicator off and the rfwc will be ready to activate those lights again have funi’m messing with it right now myself but i’m finding some bugs and don’t have time to fix right now from your inputs it looks like you have added your device twice you need to set it up via scenes or via association the dimming duration is only valid if using scene commands if you are using scene commands the device its self must be configured with the scene number and the brightness level see the sample device driver for linear devicesi had a type casting error on the level setting being set to the configurationset command give it a try nowyes i had that same thing it has to do with a global state being tested prior to it being created i think i added a statement in the initialize routine that seemed to fix it on my end try reinstalling the dh in your ide again it should initialize if you are running the latest i guess i should put a version number in there i made a few more edits to the code this evening and posted it to get hub i will update the link abovei learned tonight that unit does not seem to send button held commands to anything that is activated via association only scene activated devices as far as i can tell that’s a bit of a let down as i was hoping to control my ge fan controli fired up another controller tonight at this point i only have one onoff switch associated to the switch install and setup went flawlesslybelow is a simple webcore piston that demonstrates setting indicators on the rfwc imagepng1178×564 388 kb the piston simply causes indicator 3 to follow indicator 1it looks like you are attempting to set up device via association so i will address it that way the entries in assoccap1 must be followed by a comma and level like this 03 255 use 0 for off 255 for on with switches and 0 to 100 for dimmers if you have more than one device to activate with a button make a list device1 level1 device2 level2 the dimdur value is only used for scene capable devices the scene number need only be set if using scene capable devices so both of those can be blank any feedback on making the instructions in the dh more clear would be appreciatedfirst thing check that you have the latest code for the rfwc controller i should say version 14 in the comments section at the top of the code if you do you should be able to hit the configure button to get things set up if that does not work try a reinstall second your entries look correct for using association it should be turning the devices on the above should work cure that the devices that are controlled via association need only be able to respond to basic commend set to work jd is correct you do have scene capable devices they have the 2b and 2c command sets you will be happier if you set them up via scenes as you will be able adjust the brightness via the rfwc with a button hold you will need to use the dh for the dimmers i modified i have modified the type line in the dh to recognize the evolve dimmer github.com

charger img201804071110572160×3840 207 mb i am pretty happy with the result one of them had range extender the vendor claims that it has 1 km range i am not sure that this range is make sense for zigbee i personally plan to use it on the area that is harder to cover i really doubt that i will get 1 km with the environment where i am and the antenna that i use i do have a few modules built i will be happy to share them with a member here for free i do want to get as much testing as possible if you are interested to get one please do help me with testing and give me feedback hopefully one day i can kickstarted this project let me know if you are interested on testing them you will need to provide your own 5v usb charger and antenna any 50 ohm 24ghz antenna with ipx connection should work you can try and play round with fancy high gain antenna or directional antennajdroberts thank you so much for the questions here is the limited test that i did i have done some test using the zigbee sniffer i saw a lot of packet being routed through the module i also double check with xbee map i saw i had the same count of 3 endpoint device modules in xbee map and the smartthings dth sorry for redacted 64 bit address i just want to be careful imagepng932×543 923 kb i would be open to suggestion in term of further testingtrirocketman i would like to try one of your units with the external antenna i am trying to get some coverage to my garage which is over 100ft from the house and i have not had much luck if your extender works it would be a big help for me i am kinda new with all this stuff so i would need some instructions to set it up let me know you will need the following 5v usb phone charger see one of my pictures antenna like this one you can go fancy and test out high gain 24ghz antenna as long as it si 50ohm antenna with ipx connector i will share a dth in github you just need to upload it on your smartthings account as device type handler and publish it once you have done the above the pairing will be the same as any other zigbee device i only have 4 repeater that has extended range i let you decide whether you need one or two if you can put the repeater in the middle between your device and hub or closest router device you can probably get by with one otherwise you should try use two as kind of bridge each repeater in range of the hub and device you try to connect to this create some sort of bridge please let me know best on your judgement how many you need pm me with your address i would love to spread the module to as many people as possible however i want to have it the best chance to work as wellkamran i would be interested in trying this i have a 8000 square foot lot and often have connection drops my antenna has a coaxial connectionwould this work i use antenna like this as long as it has the ipx connector you should be able to use them i am hoping that you can try to find different type of antenna to test as so that i can get more data they just need 24ghz 50 ohms antenna many antenna with this spec may compatible with 5ghz it may also work 24ghz5ghz antenna is more common as they are used for wifi as well i personally looked for 24ghz antenna for my test please pm me if you are interested please see the my other reply let me know the quantity that you may need would you be looking an idea to bridge locations the long range module only help on the transmitting part your end device need to have enough power to get to the repeater as welljust an update i only have the following quantity of module 4 extended range module with external antenna they potentially are gone based on the first two request 3 module with external antenna still available i will have more made with additional sensors for a few more weeks again they will be in small quantity i can not get huge quantity and give them for free i do apologize that i can only share them for those member with usa address only shipping to another country could be prohibitively expensivethere is no soldering the board and the correct antenna would connect like below you need to plug them together gentlyderrek113116cchilds1976trirocketman i am sending the modules today here is the github link for the device type handler you have to add the dth in your smartthings account once you do that the rest of the process will be the same as like adding other zigbee devices i believe that have posted a link to antenna that i use please try out other antenna as well i will be interested on how they perform kamran are you still interested on testing the module if not i will pass it on to someone elsecslee i have one non extended module left you do have the option to play around with the antenna there are some high gain antenna that you can use pm me if you are interested',\n",

       " 'trend setter a smartapp for grouping devices read first i am not usually one for releasing stuff i write because i am my own worst critic and usually self destruct before putting anything out into the general public i’ve revised this post more times than i’d like to count i am trying to change that behaviour although i am a software engineer by trade i am not a javagroovy developer so i may not have written some of the code in the most efficient way i expect this to change from feedback and as my knowledge grows i tend to find i use the app to control a lot of things more than anything else so this is useful for that i have only used this on an android phone and can’t be sure how it’ll behave on an ios device due to the parity issues between android and ios apps so give no guarantee of how well it’ll work for you if people actually want to use this smartapp i will attempt to maintain it and add additional features when i can i am generally quite busy and was fortunate enough to have some time to work on this to get it to where it is pull requests are welcome anyway i’ve been putting off posting this long enough i hope this is of use to someone or that someone will tell me that what i’ve done is pointless and there is a better solution either way it was a good learning experience what is trend setter trend setter is a smartapp for grouping together devices for synchronised control andor data aggregation using virtual devices that act as a controller device and interface for other devices in the group at present there are 4 group types switch group switch control dimmer group levelswitch control colorful light group colourlevelswitch control power meter averaged total power usage for group with highmediumlow usage indicator based on previous data experimental unfinished and probably very inaccurate why did i make this this started when i got my first couple of osram lightify bulbs i have 2 lamps in my lounge and wanted to be able to control the lights in a group i tried using other solutions where a master device dictates to the other devices but wasn’t really happy with that and wanted to try something else technically this does the same thing except the master device is not a physical device and also gives another degree of control and state reporting i have tried my best to make it as easy as possible to add new group device types most of the behaviour is contained within the device type itself the only thing the smartapp knows specifically about the device is a device definition so it knows what to subscribe to and how to build the ui i understand that this doesn’t solve a problem that doesn’t already have a solution but i am getting some use out of this so thought i’d see if anyone else could too group types switch a simple switch really only difference is it’ll give you a percentage of how many devices in the group are turned on and give you a different state depending on if they are on mostly on half on mostly off or off screenshot20151207120827png450×800 352 kb screenshot20151207120848png450×800 468 kb screenshot20151207120902png450×800 482 kb screenshot20151207120912png450×800 398 kb dimmer almost the same as a switch group but has the ability to adjust the light level if a device in the group is not in sync with the rest of the group a button to synchronise the devices in the group to the most common light level can be tapped if all the devices in the group are different levels then an average of all light levels will be used these are reflected in the slider value screenshot20151207121033png450×800 473 kb screenshot20151207121222png450×800 626 kb colorful light again almost the same as switch and dimmer but with colour control the hue and saturation sliders behave in a similar way to the level slider on the dimmers except that it won’t average the values across the groups as that might produce a colour you weren’t expecting instead it’ll use the huesaturation last set in the group this may not work for all rgbhue lights i only have osram lightify rgbw bulbs at the moment screenshot20151207121400png450×800 657 kb screenshot20151207121427png450×800 894 kb power meter experimental this is a work in progress and quite experimental what it does is adds up the power usage in the group aggregates the last 5 totals and then averages them the reason for this is because there might be a large number of events being thrown out due to the number of devices in the group i suspect that it makes the numbers somewhat inaccurate and i may change how this works maths are not my strong suit so i will see what happens using the previous totals some upper and lower average boundaries are calculated so we can classify the current usage as low medium or high with the maximum value used as a trigger to recalculate the boundaries if the current average power usage goes over the last recorded maximum value this power usage classification isn’t really of much use except for something to look at in the app as there isn’t a capability for it screenshot20151207121542png450×800 381 kb screenshot20151207121632png450×800

kriskittrendsetter author chris kitch description uses virtual child devices to group other devices together and perform commands and aggregate data from the group this file has been truncated show original notes i have attempted to aggregate changes to group devices as much as possible to prevent strange ui behaviour that i was witnessing this does incur a slight delay on updates to the group device you can make subgroups by adding a group device to another group but behaviour might be a bit odd if you also include the same devices in the parent group that are in the subgroup inheritance for device types would have made this a lot easier to maintain local processing would likely make a big difference as sometimes latency can cause strange behaviour being able to allow device selection by specifying multiple capabilities as if to say ‘devices must have all these capabilities’ would be a big bonus for making a more specific list of selectable devices being able to filter out specific devices from a list of devices to be selected would also make things easierit’s not quite what i’d expect no is there anything in the recent activity that shows the original value being set then the value you were changing it to if that’s the case then it’s likely the hue has sent out a level change event before changing the level to what was requested if not it might be a quirk of the mobile app difficult to know without being able to see it myself glad it works otherwise though i get a few strange bits of behaviour sometimes with my lights where one will just stop changing colour for a few times but the other keeps up fine but i’m putting that more down to the fact that it’s running in the cloud and my connection to it may not always be that reliablei do get the odd occasion where my lights go out of sync for no reason but i’m putting that down to the bulbs themselves since nothing is logged to suggest st is sending any commands to cause it i don’t have the ability to update the firmware which apparently fixes some issues but don’t want to have to buy the hub for the sake of updating them they are osram lightify bulbs see how you get on if there’s a problem and a pattern you can discern when i may be able to figure out a solution i may make it so that when lights are turned on using the controller device it sends the level and colour to all bulbs in the group to ensure they’re all the samethat’s is disappointing sadly debugging the app in relation to a smartappdevice type is kind of difficult as the code isnt what runs on the mobile app it’s more of a descriptor of what the app should display and somewhat how it should behave there’s little i can do to resolve it without it happening in a way i can replicate it even then i doubt anything i can change would resolve the issue i suspect a change to the mobile app may have caused thisvery strange the first bug you mentioned not sure how to see what the issue is second bug it looks like they handle the colour change differently than what i would have expected if i am able to get hold of the source code for the lifx handler it might show the reason i am away for the next couple of days but will have a look asap as for the feature request if you change an individual bulb in a group it shouldn’t effect any of the other bulbs in the group it will just show in the controller device that not all the bulbs stakes match what you’re asking for should already workroutines aren’t really the same as they’re designed to run multiple commands over multiple devices of potentially different types trend setter is there to keep multiple devices of the same type in sync with a single control point the virtual device although they can still be controlled individually or even with ‘subgroups’ but not sure how well that’ll work as have done little testing you could even use the virtual controller device within a routine if you wanted hope that makes sensecould you elaborate',\n",

       " 'there are two different approaches to adding rgbw led strips to a samsung smartthings ™ setup since there are now a number of different brands offering choices for both approaches i thought it was time for a new thread if you have personal experience with any particular brandmodel specifically with how well they integrate the new v3 smartthings app please add it to this thread or link to an existing thread since this is 2020 please limit conversations to the new app although custom code required is fine as long as it works with the v3 app smart led strips often the easiest way to do this is just to buy smart led strips these may look like an rgbw bulb to smartthings but will work just fine check product descriptions carefully as these usually come in a starter set which includes the plugin power module and then offer optional extension pieces to make the strips longer these also typically work off of regular 120v outlets in the us different brands do have different features for example the wifi lifx strips require their own gateway and make a cloud to cloud connection but let you set different parts of a single strip to different colors hue strips work best with their own bridge but that bridge can form a local connection with smartthings if you have a smartthings hub or can be used in a cloud to cloud integration if you have smartthings set up in a hub optional configuration sylvania smart strips can be joined directly to a smart things hub you don’t need an additional bridge device the biggest drawback to this group is their cost dumb strips smart controller sometimes a less expensive option is to use regular dumb led strips but add a smart controller that can talk to smartthings note that some of these will need to be spliced into the existing wiring and some will need a transformer one of the first of these was the fibaro rgbw zwave controller it works very well and has a lot of advanced features like also being able to accept input from analog sensors it also allows you to control individual channels separately it will work directly with smartthings no additional bridge device required however it’s still pretty expensive in the last two years we have seen more options that are less expensive particularly zigbee 30 controllers from gledopto and wifi controllers from sonoff the gledopto controllers can be used either with the hue bridge or directly with smartthings they are very popular they will look like in rgbw bulb to smartthings color control is sometimes a little better if you use them with the hue bridge setup for the sonoff devices can be technically pretty complicated as many people will flash the firmware on these devices in order to let them work directly with smartthings but if you’re ok with a technical setup process and you want to save some money these are a very popular choice there are many additional brands in this category but quite a few are inexpensive chinese knockoff‘s of sonoff or gledopto and don’t typically have the same safety certifications hopefully some of the people who are using well engineered alternatives from other brands will add reviews to this thread zemismart and rgbgenie are good examples of lesser known brands in this category that seem to have decent engineering however community reports have been that color control is not always accurate with these summary i will

relates to zwave or zigbee heartbeats all my cloud devices all show inactive and work fine hell even my philips hue lights connected by the hue hub do as well but as said nothing at all to worry about or fixdechlanjacobs i have been meaning to revisit this as smartthings still havent fixed the delay or delaybetween commands as this handler was refreshing as soon as the door moving time has elapsed as an workarorundimprovement i have scheduled the refresh now to run every 1 minute which is the minimum st will now allow with the standard schedule commands this is the best i can currently do with st limitations but it should be a big improvement on the existing version the updated version is now on github so please updatedechlanjacobs the status immediately shows opening when you request the state to change the garadget device doesn’t show as open until the door moving time has elapsed i had programmed a status refresh to occur after a delay that matched the door moving time but the delay function is broken in st and has been for quite some time now and i doubt it will work any time soon so with the new version i pushed yesterday if the garage door opening is triggered the status is immediately shown as opening and at the next refresh up to a minute later as it refreshes every minute the status will change to open if the garage door is still open at that point i don’t see how else this can be achieved easily without the delay functionality working regards stuart buchanandrabulhoda pm me the log from live logging under garadget connect when you attempt to add this will help me troubleshoot for you',\n",

you see fit tagging veeceeoh and minerjasonmvevitsis are these accurate 13000 lux seems like a lot for my 100w bulb to be putting out that’s the value being returned by the sensor and i didn’t change or convert it but if that needs to change it would be a simple thing to do see my updates in a post further down with updates from may 6 2020mine has been working great and i ordered 2 more a couple weeks agojlv how is the battery life on this i see it uses a cr2450 i’ve had it for just over a month and it reports lux changes immediately so far it still says 100 i’m keeping an eye on that pretty close to get a feel for battery life so far so goodroykwong i just got my xiaomi light sensor and work very well with the dh can receive lux and battery level but the value of lux is rather on high side over 20000 for internal lighting normally should be a few hundred to few thousand also the sensor is very sensitive the lux keep changing and reporting to hub even there is no observable light change is there any way to reduce the reporting frequency i don’t want the battery drain away too fast this is the raw data value the device sends to the st hub when the value changes but i believe i may have found something from another st dth that i need to use a conversion process i just found that tonight so give me a day to look that over and test there is also a way to configure the device to not reports as often so i will test that as well i will post an update here when it’s ready fyi mvevitsisroykwong waiting your good news fyi mvevitsis here are the updates cleaned up code and resolved large lux values by using zigbeelux to convert raw value to lux added a preference to adjust minimum illuminance reporting time and a preference for the amount of change in raw lux data please update to the latest release here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsconstantelos/smartthings/master/devicetypes/jsconstantelos/my-xiaomi-mijia-smart-light-sensor.src/my-xiaomi-mijia-smart-light-sensor.groovy once you save and

change in the raw data to be detected 21 is default when you save andor exit from settingspreferences a config will be initiated to update the sensor this may take a few minutes for the sensor to change and sometimes it takes a couple attempts because it’s a sleepy device battery powered i will be testing values for each over the next day or two so let me know how things go for you you can see debug events in live logging in the ide edit even though i’ve set these 2 values 60 seconds and 100 raw data change the sensor doesn’t seem to honor them screenshot202005062307341440×2560 124 kbi also saw a discussion within the hubitat community where they saw the same behavior with this device not honoring certain settings i’m not too worried about that to be honest but i will keep an eye on

until the blue led starts to quickly blink or three blinks at a time can’t remember sorry the hub will see the rejoin and you should see those events in your hub’s event log rejoin close to the hub or close to the nearest zigbee repeating device where the sensor will be placedhmm ok can you bring up live logging in the ide and then press the button on the sensor click on the sensor name in live

       " 'i’m using a smartthings multipurpose sensor on my garage door i’ve seen old references in this forum to the new vs old sensors mine was purchased a week ago and has the coin battery in it i have configured it for use on a garage door and oriented it correctly on the door with the raised bar on the cover oriented vertically on the right side of the sensor it works totally reliably when the door is opened giving me both a vibration alert and showing open roughly 25 of the time when i close the garage door it subsequently shows status as still open it does however give the vibration alert when closing tapping the sensor seems to make it unstick and report closed it is mounted on the top panel of 5 panels i believe to give the earliest possible indication that it is open to my untrained eye that top panel looks just as vertical as the rest of the panels so i don’t think the cause is that top panel being not quite vertical it is reporting temperature ok so this means it’s not out of range correct i would expect if it was out of range it would report null for temperature which maybe the gui would report as 273 celcius in case it might be a range issue the sensor is located one floor down and about 15’ horizontally from the hub battery is at 100 any suggestions on what i might be doing wrong i’d like to improve reliability of it reporting open only when it is actually open thanks mikehow do i get that detail i can’t see it from the st app my home things the sensor right now i can just see activeinactive temperature battery and a refresh logowhen closed 31311033 when open 10323186 i have openedclosed it three times and each time the sensor correctly identifies it as garageclosed murphy’s law dictates that i can keep opening and closing and fail to reproduce the problem until after i am away from my pci will check the zaxis value next time it fails with my luck it will be when i am leaving for work and i won’t be able to check until i get home at which point i will open close the garage door again and it will probably not fail that time i wonder what unit it is measuring clearly not whole degrees since it needs to be at least 900 to register as closed and there’s this whole range from 100900 where the state remains unchangedah yes measuring g makes more sense i wondered if the max was a nice round hex number 1033 is bigger than 1024 maybe i’m in a gravity well i hasn’t failed since maybe i scared it into submission you’ve given me some ammo for checking this out next time it failsthanksok it failed this morning probably did not fully register the close when it closed threeaxis 10674080 so that value 80 when it is closed but registering as open is a long way from the threshold at which it should register closed minimum 900 maybe it’s defective but not all the timewill do thanksthanks i’m actually using the temperature sensor feature of this sensor as well as tilt so i will give the replacement some time to see if it behaves if the replacement misbehaves also i will look at the monoprice oneupdate the replacement behaves the same way intermittently telling me it’s open what’s odd is that i have a shm rule that sends me a push notification when the door opens and when it closes that notification does not trigger when the sensor decides it has gone from closed correct value to open incorrect value so i think i will be sending the replacement back and maybe look at monoprice btw maybe this is a range issue it’s only my second zigbee device but tbh if it was a range issue i would expect it to report unknown rather than open',\n",

       " 'why are there only 8 smartapps to choose from android smartthings app this doesn’t give the impression that there’s much focus on this area should we be looking at something elsenathancu there’s tons of them just have to go look look where do you mean github and install the webhooksthanks everyone for responding to my question i’m quite new to home auto so it’s really helpful to catch up with how far things have come forgive the following summary it probably comes across as quite harsh and negative but hopefully it will be responded to with encouragement for the future rather than laurels for our bums so in reply to paraphrase where have all the smartapps gone we have had nathancu here at the smartthings community jdroberts https://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=how_to_quick_browse_the_community-created_smartapps_forum_section essentially this was where i was coming from that there are only 8 consumer selectable smartapps the rest are scriptsprograms mostly hosted on github presumably the consumer community is where the success of smartthings rests not the developer community it’s a bit like google saying well we only have 8 apps in google play but hey look at all these android studio projects in github you only have to look smart lighting smarthings home monitor these are 2 of the 8 aren’t they more on this later custom automations similarly more on this later rules api still in development webcore haven’t looked at this yet but thanks i will check it out i’ve had a look at smart lighting it allows me to select multiple lightsscenesdevices it allows me to select one trigger i like the sunset trigger because that happens to be mostly when i use lights it allows me to choose a time offset too will wonders never cease what’s more having selected multiple lights it even allows me to choose a dim level but it has to be the same level for all lights personally in 2020 i would hesitate to describe this as smart similar restrictions apply to the automations feature imo i will give an example of what i think is a reasonable expectation for a new consumer i have a dimmable night light and a motion sensor on my stairs i would like it to brighten continuously i don’t like lights that suddenly go from 0 to 100 in case you are wondering from off to 1 starting at sunset±x and reach 100 by sunset± i’d like it to darken continuously from whatever level it happens to be from the previous rule at t local time to 1 at t2 and remain there till sunset it may be assumed i live south of the arctic and north of the antarctic notwithstanding these rules if motion is detected i would like the light to brighten to say 20 for a short while ideally if i manually turned the light onoff these rules shouldn’t interfere with that choice i don’t think this is an unreasonable requirement so can you point me to a ready made solution a customer of 2020 probably ought to expect this to be out of the box as a starter app where i think this usecase challenges the smartthings model is that it is specifying how i want the device settings to be when certain conditions hold while smarthings development talks about what to do to devices when certain triggersevents happen sometimes we live in world with an integration sign in front rather than a differentiation sign jodyalbritton let me know if you are developer interested in doing this i’m a retired developer and getting quite interested in home automation so i’d certainly be interested in contributing to effort however as a third party developer i can’t say i’m experiencing too much receptiveness to suggestions from my perspective it looks more like it starts with we have developed this api and we will show you how to use it but then my experience has been there is still some work in progress and documentation that needs to be fixed let alone a getting started link that fails to get you started i’m actually earlyretired which means i have a bit of life in me yet with some development energy to spend however i’m loathe to spend too much of that energy utilising a schedules api that unleashes 80 of the power of cron and a rules api that unleashes 80 of the power of boolean algebra but yeah jodyalbritton i’d love to dm to discuss some thoughts i’m not a professional developer any more though the fact that i’m retired early might be a claim to being a reasonably good one in the past and the home automation area has become a new interest i’m going to spend more time on home assistant soon as i only recently discovered thisi have indeed discovered scenes but as you say they are actually activated events use of nouns to mean a verb always misleading webcore does look very interesting and i will split some time between home assistant and that going back to the 8 consumer selectable smartapps it does seem me all the other roads lead to github maybe the user of 2020 ought to expect something more than a ctrla ctrlc ctrlv mechanism for software installation or maybe they have just gotten too used to app stores and certification and package signing and versioning and compatibility maintenance and all thati did notice while browsing through the github repos that manymost are written in groovy i think i’m missing some history here since i’ve only been looking at for a couple of months but as i understand it there was an older version of smartthings and now there’s a new world so i’ve heard of two android apps classic and errrnot classic and there apps written in groovy in an old ide but in the new workspace it’s just webhooks and aws lambdas so my question is is there a migration plan for all this is the way ahead webhooks and aws and will groovy be going away actually is there a picture of where everything sits everything seems to be smart and an app or a automation but where does the classical world end and the modern one beginjodyalbritton as i said previously you can get most functionality from the the built in apps and the automation builder just try hitting and then clicking on automation as i said previously i had looked at what’s already there smartapps automations scenes do any of them give me the kind of appliance like utility that i get from my 25 year old heating timer controller with battery backup for the internal clock which is aware of when onoff times are and were it to be interrupted by a power cut or have it’s routine slightly augmented by a request for an extra hour and when things return to normal it knows what state the heating should be in my mum has a 45 year old electromechanical timercontroller when her power goes off for a minute it performs almost as well it just loses a minute it doesn’t wait until the hour hand comes round again at the same time tomorrow you seem to feel happy that smartapps and automations cater for 80 of all use cases but in terms of simplicity i would suggest that the simple nightlight example i described earlier with the movement sensor brightness boost would belong to the first 10 of essential use cases is this supported with similar simplicity to my and my mum’s vintage heating controllers that was a question i had asked earlier i believe the answer is not out of the box but it’s in github imagine what the reaction would been if the typewriter had been invented to cater for 80 of all letters perhaps you would then suggest that since we support 80 of the digits too we can always type the octal ascii code for the letters that aren’t supported where am i going with this i think it’s valid to put out there a requirement which i think is reasonable which is that the consumer’s mobile app should expose something that is more akin to an appliance than a flowchart starting with cron and event triggers what do i think the response has been so far what we have done so far ought to be good enough for you and what we haven’t done yet will address what you currently want are those really or are they complete blackout glasses i was hoping that instead of pushing the ctrla ctrlc ctrlv method of software distribution or at attempting to unleashing through encapsulation 80 of the capabilities of cron schedules and boolean algebra rules automations you might want to tell us how life in front of the integral by dt might be supported as well as life in front of the differential by dt jodyalbritton there is some history to all of the legacy groovy stuff but that is a post for another time for those of us who were born after the schism of classic and modern would it be possible to describe what the future of groovy is without leaving it for another time similarly with device type handlers the history however bloody or not it might have been surely shouldn’t still enslave and prevent us from making a clear statement about the future for example it’s deprecated but no firm timescales have been set and new development should take place with the endpointaws style deprecated meaning the way i’ve come across it before ie it still works it’s not supported though and in the future it will probably become nonfunctional it might not even stay that way but i think it should be made clear it’s only very late on that i became even slightly sure that i should look at endpointaws rather than groovy because everywhere i looked on github it was almost all groovy the classic ide looks like a proper developer tool unlike the smartthings workspace with it’s enormous screen estate and 2 enormous links to get started and that really is for another postthanks for telling me that i really did not know that was how that emoji was used i thought it was just to mean happy with that because that was the only context i’d seen it used before i am slightly more enlightened that i was this morning i hope no offence was taken and none was intended with regard to your condition',\n",

have the rules setup to lock the xfinity the keypad doesn’t turn red like when it is armed from the keypad itself this is by design in this instance the keypad is being used as standalone lock device and not a general security keypad the purpose of the light is to show the status of the lock device locked or unlocked so when you lock it via the keypad it turns red and when unlocked it’s greenwhite

       " 'i recently purchased may 2020 some somfy window shades and embarked on integrating them with smartthings there is a bunch of information online about integrating somfy with st but the information is of varying vintage and scattered all over the place this integration guide is an attempt to consolidate this content in a centralized spot to make easier on community members setting up this same integration i found success with imnotbob’s somfyshades community device handler but that’s not to say the other community device handler is not an option a bunch of this information was gleamed from my own testing trial error so your mileage might vary please note that this guide pertains to somfy zrtsi somfy zwave to radio technology somfy interface integration i only own somfy shades and not somfy blinds so i can’t comment on the window blindst experience please note that this guide does not pertain to the somfy mylink rts smartphone and tablet interface nor somfy mylink app stepbystep guide in the new st app add your zrtsi hub in the smartthings new app by clicking the devices then ‘scan nearby’ it will add it as a generic zwave controller which is okay and desired on the physical zrtsi device program the virtual nodes and conduct the rts programming it’s all described here but if programming is failing make sure you’re holding down the stupid selectok which is not described well in the guide https://service.somfy.com/downloads/nam_v4/zwaveto_rts_instructions.pdf after programming your virtual nodes vnodes add them to the new st app by using ‘scan nearby’ as described in step 1 each window shade will appears as a generic dimmer switch in st which is functional but not desirable as it only provides openclose functionally without the pause function if you don’t care about window shade presets and can’t be bothered to install a community device handler then i would recommend that you login your smartthings webgui https://account.smartthings.com/ navigate to the devices screen click on one of your somfy window shades press the edit button change the type field from dimmer switch to zwave window shade press the update button and then repeat this step for all somfy window shades this will give your open close and pause functionally in the new st app classic st app and action tiles if that’s your jam you’re finished with this guide and your somy shades will be modeled as window shades in st and not dimmer switches if the notion of window shade presets appeal to you then skip step 5 above a preset is a desired position where you automatically want your shade to physically stop at for instance i have a shade installed on a window that opens from the bottom to the top so i set the preset just above the window opening so i can physically open the window to let some air into the room yet still having the window shade covering the top fixed portion of the window so the sun or moon is not beaming into the room no longer do i have to close the blind with the remote and then wait to manually hit the stop button at the desired position first you need to program each window preset on your physical somfy remote control i have the telis 4 remote with the my button on it using the remote manually move the shade updown to the desired preset level now hold down the my button until the shade jobs you have successfully programmed the preset for this shade repeat this preset programming for all of your shades please note presets are recallable on your physical somfy remote by selecting the desired shade and then pressing the my button twice it’s not a doubleclick like on a computer mouse but two distinct presses with a little pause into between in other words don’t tap it too fast otherwise it won’t register the double press install the i’m not bob somfyshades community device handler from the following url https://github.com/imnotbob/somfy-shades/ i won’t repeat the installation instructions as notbob has already documented them once you’ve install the dth go back to to smartthings webgui https://account.smartthings.com/ navigate to the devices screen click on one of your somfy window shades press the edit button change the type field from dimmer switch to somfyshades press the update button and then repeat this step for all somfy window shades click on one of your somfy shades in the device list under the device screen that lists all the properties click on the edit button under the preferences section type in shades without the double quotes in the text box and this will set the shadetype enumeration to shades i don’t own any somfy blinds so your mileage will vary if you’re reading this guide and programming blinds i needed to do this step otherwise the preset doesn’t work under the classic st app your somfy shades will register as window shades and you’ll have a beautiful looking presetstop button in addition to open and close under the new st app things aren’t looking as pretty at the time of this writing may 2020 you get the openclosepause control via a gear control which is fine but certainly not ideal the preset looks like the logical choice for setting your window preset but sadly it throws a network or server error occurred try again later instead you need to use the shade level slider control which is not intuitive by any stretch of the imagination but it works just slide it to any random percentage of your choosing other than the current value and this will trigger the shade to move to the preset that you physically set with your somfy remote and remembered by your somfy motor under actiontiles add them as window shade instead of switch and they’ll be modeled as shades in at if you click on the name of the tile you’ll get the details window where you get the same goofy slider control for navigating to your window preset but it works under alexa you can now create a new routine like so name bedroom shades open when you say alexa open bedroom shades add action smart home all devices select the desired window shade or shades set the desired percentage 100 open 0 close 50 preset under the new st app you can create scenes that act as shortcuts for closing opening presenting single or multiple shades with a press of a single button click on the hamburger button at the top of the new st app and then select scenes it’s the same programming as alexa 100 is to open the shades 50 is to preset your shades and 0 to close your shades under the new st app you can do some neat programming under automation that is accessible via the hamburger icon too for instance before bedtime say at 930pm every night fully close two of my shades but preset my third shade to my desired level so i can open the window at night without fiddling with the shade position additionally i have the ecobee thermostat with a remote ecobee sensor in our bedroom i created another automation to fully close all our master bedroom shades if the temperature in our bedroom reaches 27 degc 80 degf and there has hasn’t been any motion in the room for the last ten minutes as to not freak out my wife with the shades auto closing if she’s in the bedroom the idea of this last automation is to prevent our master bedroom from cooking on a hot day if all the window shades were open side note if your somfy motors are making a clunking noise when opening the shades you most likely have the physical top limit of the shade set too high and you should lower it until it stops making this noise this can be quite jarring on the motor and perhaps affect the longevity of the motor i have the somfy shades with the rechargeable battery packs to reset the memory on these shades hold down the physical lightbutton on the shades for 10 seconds until the shade jogs three times i point this out because it was difficult for me to find this reset procedure online as it varies depending if you have ac power or battteries once resetting the shade follow otto’s instructions to reprogram the shade including physical stop limits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jmagn1vs1i i hope this helps cheers hershey',\n",

stepbystep instructions here faq an overview of using custom code in smartthings smartthings classic faq so you’re new to smartthings you asked a question and someone suggested custom code as an answer or you were browsing the forums and you found something that sounded like it would be perfect for what you wanted but again uses custom code what does that mean how hard is it to do and what’s the difference between a smartapp and a device type handler note the official terminology has changed a couple of times device type handler device handler dth and device type all mean the same thing and you will find all these terms used in the forums section i smartapps and device handlers what they are smartapps tiny programs to decide what a specific device should do when or to collect the information from a specific device smartapps including the various fsorry for the confusion fixing it now it really is supposed to be kofceilingfan as i needed to delete forks from stephack and from ranga that is causing confusion i gave it the prefix name of ceiling to differentiate the repositories from each other if you setup with ide integration to the kofceiling fan repo do an update from repo to get the latest code and publish it again i am traveling all day today so maybe stephan can chime in edit my original timing was to get this out on the weekend before my travel so i apologize for not being able to test the repo downloading before i leftjust got back home from travel looking at it now stephan see if you can spot anything wrong with my github syntax i may just need to delete all my kof devices and see what happens from scratch update see if the 500 error is gone now i think it was all due to the filenames having spaces and not dashes llama11amaduck sorry for issues you are having i did a test by removing my devices and reupdated from repo and it is working for me your screen shot doesn’t show the device’s being connected to the repo the green color indicates that the device handlers are in your ide only and not in any repository color coded names see my screen below and they should be black color with the kofceilingfanmaster repo location shown fyi the two child devices do not have to be published to have this all work as you see in my screen capture below imagepng1748×648 537 kb to connect to my repo in your ide go to my device handlers click settings button click add new repository enter owner dcoffing name kofceilingfan branch master then click save button then to click update from repo button select kofceilingfanmaster and it should pull up in the obsolete column all three of the kof device handlers for you to select after selecting them select publish checkbox and execute update also to help in troubleshooting i added version info to each

devices fan fan speed and light please imagepng886×664 473 kbchadbailey it’s working fantastic i agree stephack has done phenomenal work on this new parentchild device function and this past week on adding the feature of custom icons per child device so the ui is getting very polished with some customized icons to take full advantage of this i did a video showing all the latest ui improvements and will post it up later update i just updated the original post with the new ui screens shots and video link so this is a great time to do an update from repo if you are not at ver 20170430 or greaterpaulchampagne since it appears that the child side is not working with android for now should i still install them in order for the controller to work properly everything works just fine install all three on android the only part that doesn’t open which in no way affects the operation is the ability to open up the child device independently directly from the parent all the child dth work great and you can see them all from the parent device just not independently other than the light of course with shows up on the things view along side the fan parent showing the speeds sorry for the confusion i will edit the original post for clarity',\n",

lights that simply turn on are configured separately to allow for more customization turn on external sirensstrobes parent adt tools app allow as many instances of the child apps as you need for full customizability turns off sirenstrobe when adt alarm is cleared create adt buttons to enable mode changes this enables other routinessmartapps to interact with the alarm like action tiles allow configuration of alert actions to be triggered by motion and contact sensors when alarm is set and in certain modes this is a completely new versionthere is no upgrade path with that said you can run them together if you so choose you can get the app from my git repository at owner mavrrick repository adttools2 then download retrieve and publish adt tools 2 then download and retrieve it’s child apps they do not need to be published just in your list on the ide adt alert action adt homelife alert action lastly download and publish the adt tools button device type handler or by going to adt tools at smartthings by mavrrick one thing about this app is that i am trying not to duplicate functionality that is already present in the official adt app things to remember when using this smart app i don’t know what will happen if you try to use shm with it and it has other alarm states kicking off so if you do have shm running please use with care i don’t think it should cause a problem based on some code i have in it but please be careful keep in mind that depending on what child app you use the sensors are either adt centric or not when using any of the alert apps other then then new alert any sensor app the app does not actually monitor sensors or devices but for activity from the adt system so keep that in mind if you are looking for something to be done with it has to be triggered from the adt part of the system the adt alert any sensor app is monitoring the sensor and will create actions based on the alarm state but doesn’t send any notification to adt if you need different alarms to happen you can do that by setting up more instances of monitoring in the app you can install the different types of tools multiple timesplease let me know how it goes once you set it up i am open to suggestions as well as i know there is room for improvementthere have been a few changes with this app since i first posted it hear one of the big ones was a correction for a bug that was found that would prevent actions if all of the sensor didn’t have something setup please update your install with the most recent version from the repo it uses 5 child apps to enable the monitoring of the adt sensor you have and should be more reliable for alarm events the legacy version of the app is also still available under the adt tools oneapp name it will still have the bug though related to alert actions not working if all sensor types aren’t configuredanother update to the apps have been posted now you can configure each alert to either turn on lights flash lights both or none at alladded another child app today it will allow users to manipulate the the alarm mode if they choosethey need to momentary button tile devices and yes they will appear in action tilesjorgerivera the momentary buttons are used by the adt mode change child app once that app has the appropriate mode assigned to a button you can select that button and change your alarm state momentary buttons are also usable by applications like action tiles so you can then enable change from external apps or automationsafter identifying a slight issuebug with the adt mode change child app my possible solution sent me down a potential use case for some users basically i nave a new child app that will allow users to enable their non adt sensors to use the alarm status and provide much of the same ability as the adt sensor the biggest problem is that they will stil not trigger any notification to adt they would essentially enable yout o have a self monitored alarm system this is in it’s early stages but i think it is mostely functional if anyone would be up for testing it please let me know and i will get it on git hub asapi just commited the new childapp for non adt named sensors to be able to trigger unmonitored alarm events it is called adt alert any sensor when you load the app from the repo just keep in mind all this does is use the status of the adt alarm to determien of something should happen you still need non adt equipment to do the action ie siren lights ecti suspect you mean the code one puts in to disarm at the panel if i am right on what you are asking the answer is unfortunately no the only place those codes are kept from what i can tell is in the adt smart panel and on the setup of adt side of the systemi have updated the adt mode change child app and the adt alert any sensor child app this most recent update will enable the ability to keep the location alarm state in sync with the adt alarm panel once that is in sync it you will have the ability to have a exit delay for the adt alert any sensor child app this will keep you from having false alarms when it is armed and you need some time to leave the homei just committed a device handler to the repo this new device handler would replace the momentary tile that is suggested for adt mode change this device handler is simply a simulated button that allows for functionality from the new smartthings appid connect now you can use the present from the connect app with a bit more flexiabilitynow that you have the device handler loaded you just need to create the virtual device go to the device section in the ide click on the button to create device populate the required fields specify the device handler you loaded for device type and click on ok you should then have a button for use with the app',\n",

application i’ve not checked to see if it can work with smart things did anyone else try it that switch uses the smartlife app there are many other inexpensive chinese wifi devices that also use the same app in may2020 smartlife dropped their ifttt channel due to increasing costs paul hibbard a tech blogger says you can try the brilliant smart app from australia instead as it has its own ifttt channel that company told him they recently renewed with ifttt so he says it should be good for at least a year however it’s always possible that the company will shut this down for brands other than their own if it starts costing too much money ifttt.com ifttt connect your brilliant smart to philips hue location and more the brilliant smart range covers top popular models of brilliant lighting products electrical products air movement products and new homesecurity products the brilliant smart is to use the ifttt method create a virtual switch in smartthings to act as a proxy for the wifi device you need one virtual switch for each wifi device create four ifttt applets for each wifi device one to turn the device on and one to turn the device off in each direction so 2a if smartthings proxy switch turns on then turn on wifi device 2b if smartthings proxy switch turns off then turn off the wifi device 2c if wifi device turns on then turn on the smartthings proxy switch 2d if wifi device turns off then turn off the smartthings proxy switch that way if you turn the switch on or off with its own app it will still stay in sync with the proxy that’s all there is to it when you look at your smartthings app you will only see the proxy switch not the real wifi switch but that doesn’t matter it is showing you the status and if you toggle it or use it in an automation the real switch will turn on or off appropriately a different approach alexa as the man in the middle some community members have set up a virtual contact sensor to trigger an amazon routine not a smartthings routine and get integration that way it’s clunky but it can work for some households faq can i trigger an echo action without speaking to it faq warning warning warning in late april 2020 samsung released a new smartthings skill for alexa if you are using the previous skill and you disable it you will not be able to go back to it instead when you reenable the skill you will get the new one and a new one

particularly about network requirements https://www.amazon.com/tuya-technology-smart-life/dp/b01n1zvi7m there are also a couple of community – created integrations just search for smartlife that’s a chinese company it has nothing to do with samsung or smartthings just a somewhat similar name these may involve flashing the firmware on the device my only concern is that if this is like other similar switches it won’t have any safety certifications and speaking just for myself i don’t wire anything into the mains even a light switch if it doesn’t have safety certifications the convenience of home automation isn’t worth burning down the house but that’s just me tplinkkasa brand devices if you found this faq but you have the tplink or kasa brand wifi devices those do not use the

have to first be assigned to a smartlife scene see the following post mini smart socket integration i’m not an expert in any way but i have found a way to make these plugs somewhat communicate with st if this plugs use the smart life app then it is possible to make them work with ifttt and smartthings as long as you are ok with waiting 115 seconds extra for your plug to turn onoff and you count on an always on internet connection i have so far been using many of these plugs since they have been coming up on sale for months and i have found a way to bridge st and the smart life app using ifttt every single one of my plugs i can manage them via the st app asking google home to turn these onoff does update the st app and triggers the action withing the first second 1 or 15 sec so far i have the following models xsssa01 tus001 jhg01u and ymws1 the former 2 will appear iecallegari jdroberts switch uses the ewelink app instead you can use the same approa i may give it a try but may take longer i’m assume you mean ewelink light switches two different apps two different ifttt channels ifttt.com ifttt connect ewelink smart home to location ewelink email weather underground date time google sheets ifttt and more ifttt.com ifttt connect smart life to ifttt email smartlife google calendar weather underground button widget date time location and more so they will be set up in a

logged after publishing the google web app and copying its url did you log out of google and test the url to make sure that it displays the version numberpmusselman yes i did open the url after publishing the web app and i believe it said something like version 100 were you logged out of google when you tested itpmusselman no but i have closed now lets see what happens in a few minute i meant manually test that url while not logged into googlepmusselman just test on another machine that i am not logged into google on with the url results were version 010000 i just wanted to make sure it wasn’t a permissions problem if you go into the other settings section of the smartapp and enable the live logging option trace it should log more info to live logging which will help

runs entirely on the smartthings platform as a groovy smartapp connecting the the b•hyve™ api this v2 version will detect the onoff state of the b•hyve™ hose timer at the designated frequency of api polling the b•hyve™ server set in the orbit bhyve controller smartapp preference i have my smartapp set at 2 minutes polling frequency which is a compromise of polling frequency and response time to state change in this version one has the option of receiving eitherboth a sms andor push message when a b•hyve™ hose faucet timer change state of watering one can setup a webcore™ piston to create creative home automation routines based on changes in the hose faucet timer state or metadata because of the limitations of the sandboxed smartthings groovy server platform i am unable to create a websocket api connection to the b•hyve™ server in which to allow one to programmatically switch onoff the b•hyve™ hose faucet timer set the timer duration etc i have some early coding in this app ready for a v3 in which i may interface with a local rpi server running a flaskmqttnodejs server for proxying this capability but for now that is work in progress so if anyone out there has a suggestion as to how to easily connect smartthings app to a websocket api please feel free to pm me to discusshelpfor those action tiles usersimpacting change v202 for those who have added this v2

thanks for helping with this issuei going to keep working on this smartapp over the next few weeks to add more scheduling refresh choices between 110 minutes and eliminate the longer choices most of us have watering cycles that fire off for 1530 minutes and the smartapp needs to frequently poll the bhyve api server to get the status of the devices and set the smartthings events explore a means to

glad to see orbit changed their tune regarding api availability i have a 6 zone wifi indooroutdoor model and when i saw no smartthings integration i contacted them regarding an api or some way for 3rd party control they replied nope no can do since this is for the hose timer do you know if the 6 zone controllers might also be controllable the ios and android apps don’t show valve status accurately a couple of times the app showed timer was off and in fact valves were still open anyway just curious if its possible to control other bhyve models with your app or it’s a lot of effort to add other models dear hitechabyss let’s see how this 30 beta version of storbitbhyvecontroller works with your 6 zone wifi indooroutdoor model make sure you select the files from the beta branch of the github which has many code changes from the stable v2 release follow the install instructions here if you run into installconfigure errors please send me a pm on this forum and we can see how i can work to

and verified connecting to a local lan device with async updates realized that i needed a good framework to offer outside integration with smartthings so decided to write a proxy service in node making local lan integration with smartthings easier offering async update support as well as the flexibility to connect to devices via usb serial etc which are not natively supported by smartthings connectivity to the honeywell ademco alarm panel is provided by a plugin to the proxy service smartthings node proxy basic schematic of how this is wired together is provided below mode details on the

video why as a matter of fact i do https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc2x8qiyxqs what the heck is node node is awesome https://nodejs.org what the heck is json json pronounced like the name jason jaysun is also awesome http://www.json.org/ why do i need smartthings node proxy if you want to direct connect your evl to smartthings and not go through the smartthings cloud you need stnp it registers with the evl and monitors for alarm events and passes these notifications directly to the smartthings hub so all traffic stays on your local lan and notifications happen in nearrealtime how does smartthings node proxy connect with the evl and the smartthings hub blobjpg786×370 584 kb what do i need to do to get this running forget about smartthings for a second we’ll come back to that first things first let’s get smartthings node proxy installed configured and working identify a host machine on your network that can run nodejs download and install nodejs from here https://nodejs.org download smartthings node proxy and place in a target folder on your machine ie homesmartthingsnodeproxy create a subfolder called plugins ie smartthingsnodeproxyplugins move envisalinkjs from availplugins to your new plugins folder copy the contents of configjsonsample and paste them here http://jsonmate.com/ edit the document so that it matches your configuration remove all comments anthing starting with and then click beautify create a new file named configjson in your smartthings node proxy folder copy the contents of the json document into configjson install dependencies by running npm run installenvisalink or npm run installad2usb fire up the server by typing npm run start make sure that it connects with the evl and you should start to see alarm system events like motion sensors and door sensors reporting etc now we can move on to setting up the smartapp and devices in smartthings how do i know it’s running when you start smartthings node proxy you should see something like the following node serverjs smartthings node proxy listening at http://:::8080 loaded plugin envisalink connected to envisalink at 1921682324025 typepartitionpartition1statereadyalphadisarmed ready to arm what’s all this nonsense about restart.me and forever you can honestly ignore all that if it doesn’t work or you are having issues getting it run restart.me is a script that i created to make startingrestarting the service easy but it may only run on specific operating systems forever is a node module that allows you run a node application continuously sort of like a service but how do i run smartthings node proxy unattended or guarantee that it runs on startup while i don’t have a solution to that here there are many solutions available online for wrapping a node app into a service that autostarts etc and it all depends on your host operating system google is your friend http://bfy.tw/8qp9 for windows users the simplest is to probably create a shortcut to node serverjs and put that in your startup folder what are all these password and code fields in the configjson good question and i’m often left wondering the same like what the heck was i thinking when i wrote this but here it is authcode is a passcode you set for the smartthings node proxy to prevent unauthorized access to smartthings node proxy from anybodyanything who could be snooping around your local network and happen to stumble upon smartthings node proxy listening on port 8080 it’s not ft knox but it’s not meant to be just a basic passcode to keep everyone out note this is the passcode you have to use during the smartapp configuration to allow the smartapp to communicate with smartthings node proxy password is the password required to access the evl the default on the evl is user securitycode is your 4 digit or whatever code you enter on the alarm panel to armdisarm we need this code so that you can armdisarm from smartthings installercode please do not use this i have actually deleted this from the sample configjson it’s risky and there’s a 5050 chance it leaves your alarm panel in a state that will require an installer to get out of i’ve only tested this on my panel at home and while it works and saves me maybe 10 mins of configuration it’s really not worth the risk let me know if there are any other gotchas questions etc so that i can add them to this list thanksawesomelet me know how it goes and happy to help if you run into any issuesisriam the plugin could be modified or a new one built to support additional device types this has support for the standard device types doorcontact motion and smoke can you point me to the zero device typeslouis96 this should work fingers crossed only thing is i haven’t tested with evl4 and that’s what they’re selling now with regards to your questions screen shot of the smart app which is only used for configuration img5148png750×1290 644 kb screen shots of the security panel thing which have arm and disarm smarttiles img5146png750×1290 565 kb img5147png750×1290 619 kb the envisalink plugin envisalinkjs has routes to support the armaway and armstay actions you could change the last character key from 2 in the case of away or 3 in the case of stay to 7 this would allow you to do instant arm you could also add an additional button to the security panel thing and tie to the custom command route in the plugin which has been disabled by default as it allows you to send whatever key combination you want to the panel see line 79isriam hey checked out your project and it’s similar to some of the other alarmserver integrations there are some major differences in my approach worth calling out the most important for me is that all dsc honeywell ademco alarmserver integrations require smartthings oauth integration to support web services callback this to me is completely retarded especially if all your devices are on your local lan this makes sense if you are integrating with an external system such as ifttt but not if you’re connecting to an alarm panel that sits on the same network as your st what i’ve done is work around this handicap and the only documented callback method from st http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/smartapp-web-services-developers-guide/overview.html there are big differences between dsc and honeywell ademco panels the inputs and responses from the systems are completely different even though envisalink is being used to talk to the panel if you look at the github projects from kholloway matttw and oehokie you’ll see what i mean this is childish but i hate python and love node would love to see someone build an envisalinkdsc plugin for the smartthings node proxy that seems like a much easier task and would eliminate all the oauth nonsensekurtsanders great to hear please feel free to contribute to the github repo and let me know if there is anything i can do to helppin exactly what kurtsanders said you need to first make sure that the smartthings node proxy is connecting to the evl successfully recommend you take the following steps open web browser and verify access to the evl4 via static ip ie http://10.0.0.41 manually edit your configjson and verify that the address port and password are correct under envisalink note that the port default is 4025 and the password default is user execute the restart file and then check your log file should be in forever the log file name is actually listed when you do the restart top of the log file should say that it loaded the envisalink plugin and that is connected or give you some indication of the error see the example log file that kurtsanders has shared once you’ve verified that the smartthings node proxy is running and connected to the evl4 then go ahead and setup the smartapp and devices let us know how it goeskurtsanders exactly why i built smartthings node proxy to allow for quick integrations without having to reinvent the wheel great to see it’s useful to someone besides me i’ve taken your enablediscovery addition and committed it to the repo you should be able to pull the repo and submit changes yourself quick primer available here if you’re interested https://guides.github.com/marx redloro thanks again another great app my pleasure let me know if there is anything i can do to help make this smartapp better',\n",

handler you should add the capability to the child handler so the children show up as the relay switchesmaybe you need to exclude and repair your device when it creates the children it would have used

improvement suggestions and any other comments around this i’ve built this around how my household works but it would be interesting to hear if others find this usefulthanks cscheiene i will take a look edit i completely uninstalled the neato device and smart app and reinstalled can’t seem to recreate this anyone else having this issue maybe uninstallreinstall and see if it still happensgreat suggestion presence could certainly be added as an option to a smart schedule i am trying to keep this fairly simple core might be a better place for those with very bespoke rules interesting to hear whether whether there are more users out there where a presence option would be more useful than a mode optioni think i might have found the culprit try v11b and let me know what happenscan you open live logging whilst trying to tap an option section and paste the error message pleasei’ve recreated the issue it happens when i upgraded from v10 to v11 looking into this nowjcharr1 cscheiene should

get instant status updates for the sensors light loads and button presses the integration is all performed over your local network with no additional dependencies on ifttt stringify or other cloud services developer note i am not personally using wink relay devices any more but the integration remains available for you to use while i love the form factor i prefer running a larger wall mounted tablet with the sharptools.io dashboard now the integration is comprised of three components custom app which runs on the wink relay custom smartapp for automated device discovery custom device type handler img202005121145172016×1512 954 kb i would emphasize that this is a beta release several people have tested it at this point but there may still be outstanding bugs included features i’ve focused primarily on the twoway communication between smartthings and the wink relay this includes the following features instant status updates for temperature humidity proximity relay 1 and relay 2 top and bottom buttons control relay 1 relay 2 both relays simultaneously screen backlight additional features disable base wink relay app screen wake on touch buttons control the relays buttons can be mapped to other actions the temperature and humidity will only post an update to smartthings if they change by more than 05 units each the proximity will only change when it has changed more than 100 units notable exceptions proximity values are currently sent across as the raw value anytime the raw number changes more than 100 units it’s not clear to me what the unit of measure is for the proximity sensor so i will need to investigate this further before i feel comfortable adding some logic to map it to a motion attribute i’ve added a wakeonmotion feature to the stwinkrelay apk which lets you set a proximity threshold for waking the screen like many others i found that the proximity values drifted throughout the day if anyone figures out a better heuristic for waking the screen please feel free to share it other features this release includes a few additional features which are not exposed in the device tiles but may be helpful in other smartapps and integrations wink relay buttons the status of the wink relay buttons are mapped to attribute values in the device handler but do not display in the device tiles my thought is some people may want to use the buttons to trigger events in other smartapps for example you might use the buttons to trigger an action in webcore or on other android devices with sharptools screen backlight control the screen backlight can be controlled with the screenbacklighton and screenbacklightoff commands these can be called from other custom smartapps like webcore or sharptools installation high level instructions open the

install via adb for the webbrowser approach make sure you have unknown sources allowed for installation adb details for the adb approach download the stwinkrelayapk to your computer open a command prompt terminal change directory to the location where you downloaded the apk cd cusersyouraccountdownloads run the installation command adb install r stwinkrelay100aapk note you will either have to have adb in your path or have adb accessible in the same directory in which you have the apk downloaded if you have installation protection enabled from kingroot be sure to approve the installation physically on the device before the timer runs out open the custom wink relay app at least once note if you have root management enabled be sure to approve the permission request on the physical device before the timer runs out note there are a number of services which run in the background including device discovery services for watching the sensors and buttons and a web server for smartthings to send commands to the device these services are set to automatically start when the device is booted but you may have to open the app once immediately after installing it in order to

unclear what’s included in the updates but i believe at least one of the updates changes the default screen resolution some users have noted that the kingroot website is no longer available but you can install kingroot directly from apk pure if anyone wants to update the things that are smart wiki entry please go ahead and do so the original wiki entry author posted in this thread that they are supportive of that decision upgrading from older versions 10 how to upgrade from old versions from the wink relay open the existing stwinkrelay app tap the settings icon in the topright corner tap general update tap the get update button it will try to download and install the update but won’t be able to complete it navigate back to your homescreen and open the app drawer longpress on the existing stwinkrelay app and uninstall it open the downloads app select the stwinkrelay100a file that should be in the downloads folder already open the new stwinkrelay app and enjoy alternatively you can download things manually via a web browser on the wink relay or install via adb instructions are available at http://wink.boshdirect.complaceholderthanks for the feedback guys i will debug the

into the custom stwinkrelay app by going to http://your.wink.relay.ip:8080/device.xml and it should respond with an xml file that’s used as part of the discovery process this doesn’t necessarily mean that the ssdp part of things is working but at least means the builtin webserver is working also i found a minor bug with the devicexml where your devices will be named wink relay i’ve removed the for the next build but want to work through the discovery issues before pushing an update as this only affects the display namepen excellent the xml file looks good based on your smartthings logs it looks like the ssdp requests are being sent but the reply is never coming in i’m working on adding some tools to make it easier to review the logs from the wink relay device side but it might take me a bit to put it together in the mean time we could pull logs with adb are you familiar with using adb or pulling logcat logs the upside is this means the webserver on your device is working which means you could probably manually create the device and manually enter the mac address as the device network id to get things working but i’d like to work with you on troubleshooting the discovery process if you are up for it it sounds like other people are having similar issues so it would be be great to find the root cause and fix it ragaimeena what troubleshooting have you tried did you open the stwinkrelay custom app at least once as indicated in the instructions above if so what was displayed on the screenthe services start upon first reboot of the device or first opening the app you’ll have to make sure you are in front of the device to approve the root authorization request upon first load as wellthose additional buttons have been removed in the final version of the app i’m working on adding some additional logging to the stwinkrelay application so we can see what’s going on i will post the update when it’s ready one thing you might double check is that the wink relay is connected to your wifi the computer that you are connected to is on the same network as the wink relay and not restricted from accessing it in anyway and double check that you used the correct ip address of your wink relay and the url is formatted correctly for example i access my wink relay at http://192.168.1.80:8080/device.xml imagepng1182×881 47 kb you might also try rebooting the wink relay by tapping the button on the bottom edge of the frame below the screen wait for it to boot up and then try accessing the url again',\n",

device attribute gridstatus will now be either ongrid or offgrid to make things easier if you want to use smart lighting or other standard apps i also added a switch capability to the device type so that on indicates the powerwall is connected to the grid and off indicates a disconnectpower outage since it only added a few more lines of code i added grid status pushtext notification option as well as an option to select devices to turn off during an outage in the powerwall manager app itself i configured my app to turn off the bar fridge in the event of a power outage but now that i think about it an operational bar fridge in an extended outage might be critical i did a quick runthrough with a simulated outage but won’t be able to give it a thorough test until tomorrow when i can shut off grid power without disturbing the family let me know if this will work andor if you have other thoughts on implementationkamran awesome can’t wait to try this out once i get my powerwall still waiting on two referral red ones great i only have one so i’m curious how well this works with multiple powerwallsi’ve completed a quick test of the updates to add gridoutage status if you’ve already installed the prior version you’ll need to update both the smart app and device handler for all the changes to work properly as a side note the powerwall performed flawlessly when i cut off grid power to test the update this is the first test i’ve done on the latest v1371 software version the powerwall immediately cut over to power my home and solar continued charging the battery i think with a little care and forethought and unfortunately no air conditioning considering i’m only using a single powerwall my home power could be indefinitely sustainable without gridpower the powerwall is just plain awesomejoelrybacki just had the ability to test the offgrid functionality due to a quick power outage app identified the outage and turned off the devices i had selected at install however when power came back on instead of restoring state of the devices it turned everything on it’s a super simple implementation right now the app does provide an option to not turn the devices on after the grid outage is over but it does not currently store the state of all the devices prior to the outage and restore them to their prior condition once the outage is over i can look at adding that as an enhancement for now unfortunately the only options are to choose to have them turned on after the outage is over or choose to do nothing at all with them once the outage is over i’m currently doing the latter with my setup',\n",

tried that but it isn’t working with either of my 2 locks it doesn’t seem to get a response from the lock after sending the command to add the user code could it be because the lock doesn’t report the

your device list and post it here to me to compareyes thanks i don’t see 0x63 user codes in your list but it seems to be working for you i’m guessing there’s something different about schlage locks maybe they use sub channels to communicate like the ct100 uses sub channels for rh parameters wonder where i can get that infointerestingly casaverde supports remote codes for schalge locks http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/schlage_lockduncan and urman on another thread you had mentioned that schlage locks remote administration features are supported but they haven’t been implemented due to a backlog can you please share some pointers with us on how we can communicate setup the communication with the schlage locks so we can manually modify the device apps for now to make it work unfortunatley i can’t find any technical documentation on how to access teh remote pin code features for schlage and the setusercode is not working nothing is being returned from the lock pointers would be much appreciated thanksduncan also user should be an integer not a string duncan you are a freaking genius i’ve been breaking my head on this for weeks and only issue was i send a text instead of an integer add update and remove user all work great with the standard zwave lock device type i will post the updated smart app above one last question i’m trying to create a dynamic page ie when the user select add user it should pop up one more input for the code other when selecting delete user it should not have any inputs i can’t find the right documentation could you point me in the right direction here thanks againi didn’t have to make any changes to the device type it just worked with the standard zwave lock device type and i complete agree with you we are all reinventing the wheel here and hopefully we’ll have a app repository soon with categories i’ve even submitted these apps to st to publishi only have a schlage lock to test with maybe you can try it and let us know if the yale lock follows the same zwave commands i don’t see why not i think it should work with any lock unless the lock has a custom way to communicating the user information it’s just a smartapp so no harm donecorrect when it’s not deleting it will add or update if the slot is already filled i’m still trying to figure out how to create a dynamic page to make it clearer any help for folks who know dynamic pages would be helpful',\n",

       " 'hi everyone does anyone know if there is a device handler for the relatively new xiaomi outlet model zncz04lm i just bought it to do automations based on the power consumption but the device handlers that i have found just work for switch control ie basic onoff would really appreciate someone pointing me in the right direction or adding support on one of the xiaomi device handlers that are already out there thanksthank you for your reply johnconstantelo i have now tried the following smartpower outlet zigbee switch power zigbee metering plug zigbee power meter the zigbee outlet in the repo https://github.com/bspranger/xiaomi i can control the switch with all of them but i’m getting no power readings which is the only reason i bought this particular model in fact the switch is not intended to change at all if i can only get power reading that would be enoughthat’s correct here they are data zigbeenodetype router application 16 endpointid 01 manufacturer lumi model

plug on and off normally johnconstantelo i looked back at one dth you tried https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bspranger/xiaomi/master/devicetypes/bspranger/xiaomi-zigbee-outlet.src/xiaomi-zigbee-outlet.groovy did that one turn it onoff yes it also turns it on and off without a problem johnconstantelo it should look like this after those changes else if descmapcluster 000c descmapattrid 0055 descmapendpoint 15 def wattageint longparselongdescmapvalue 16 def wattage

really important for me at the moment i basically just want to know i the device connected to the plug is turned on or not i only have one more question for you what would i need to learn in order to figure out something like this on my own next time i guess there are 2 things that are still unclear to me at this point what do i need to learn in order to understand everything that the code inside of a dth refers to and does how did the people on the link you provided figure out what data comes from which endpoint how do they map the data sources in a new device this part is just my curiosity so let me know if you know what i would need to learn thank you so much for helping me out you just taught me a lot and saved me from buying a new plugthank you so much for taking the time to teach

       " 'hopefully this helps other users avoid the headaches i found while trying to integrate my milights with smartthings in the following instructions substitute milight with limitless led easyblub etc since as far as i’m aware they all work the same or just as a general purpose url requester here is the android method390 for google app requirements my milight app installed to smartthings code listed below and also hosted on bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/brianfreund/http-url-requester the milight controller know the ip and port it’s using 390 for the app store on google an android phone on the network capable of running the app automagic automation udp sender also need the ip address for this download and install an app called automagic automation 390 similar to tasker 299 however i was easily able to set up what i needed where tasker i’m not sure is capable download and install an app called udp sender free create a flow in automagic that when an http request is made triggers the udp sender app as a plugin to send the hex codes from http://www.limitlessled.com/dev/ create a smartapp that based on your preferences will send the http post request to your androids local ip through the automagic app which activates the udp sender that controls the lights all simply on your wifi network repeat and rinse as necessary for whatever custom eventstriggers you need here is a youtube video i created demonstrating installation to integration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzm5q54wu6u i want to call out patrick stuart pstuart and jason e jasone for their extraordinary help with their forum posting in aiding others with code definitely helped me get to where this is today as simple as it is here is the server method free requirements my milight smartthings app code listed below and also hosted on bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/brianfreund/http-url-requester the httptoshell node server and associated files hosted also on bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/jschraub/http-to-shell node version 692 or higher npm linuxmacwindows machine ideally alwayson to run the httptoshell server the milight controller again need the ip it’s using first ensure you have the required programs npm and node version 692 for me installing node through this link worked a charm on my linux machine wget qo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh bash afterwards i ran nvm install node for windows i recommend using the installer located at http://nodejs.org/ and run the same npm install ls after completion then start by pulling the latest files from the repository at https://bitbucket.org/jschraub/http-to-shell this will have the serverjs file as well as the registeredcommandsjs file essentially these two are what we’ll be configuring using npm run npm install ls while in the httptoshell directory edit your url triggers and commands in the registeredcommandsjs file examples are listed inside the file for you but here’s a quick breakdown url ‘milight1on’ this is the url that should match from the milight app in smartthings anything really works so i usually just describe the location ei url ‘hallwayon’ don’t forget your type ‘milight’ default for using the native milight commands the other choice is ‘shell’ but is only used for running external scripts i now no longer need this functionality but definitely could be useful in the future or if you have other programming experience i’m sure this could trigger a multitude of things ip ‘1921681200’ this is your milight controller’s ip address zone 1 your milight zone naturally bulbtype ‘rgbw’ depends on your bulb but could be either rgb rgbw or white color ‘white’ this is default to turn your rgbw to white but if you define the color 0255 it will turn that color after turning on ei color 176 would make it red note the lack of quote when defining a number rather than ‘white’ also it’s unnecessary if not changing the color or leaving it as whatever it was last brightness 100 has a range of 0100 and is also unnecessary if no adjustments are required off false defaults to false so you can omit this entirely when turning on but needs to become true when turning off the other optional options color brightness become dismissed after you’ve configured everything double and triple check your syntax i lost count of the errors i had due to missing commas or forwardslash then you should be able to run the server using node serverjs and it will start with a default port of 9512 configurable in the serverjs file itself though i’d be careful editing in that file send the url from the milight smartthings app triggered by your switch and it should then log on the server that it recognizes the command and also what url command was received not to mention your bulb should change accordingly acknowledgement shout out to marcus wittig from https://github.com/mwittig/node-milight-promise https://jsfiddle.net/wittigmarcus/p0xw0jks/ for not only the milight library api but also for a color selector that will show you the correct number

that as well initiallyso i apologize for the delay in this i’ve recently dug myself a hole trying to create a more reliable physical bridge with the little dongle they provide but ended up paperweighting it in the process so another one is on its way more info found here on that https://servernetworktech.com/2014/09/limitlessled-wifi-bridge-4-0-conversion-raspberry-pi/#comment-25251 prior to that i had developed a smartapp which should now be in the first post which is extremely basic and currently just does onoff functionality but i was hoping to develop it more in depth and eventually add greater user control and simple title switches as you suggested though i’m fairly new to this programming game and have no formal training in the subject so its mostly a hodge podge other code slapped together i will keep working on fully developing the app since of course for my own convenience it would a lot nicer than the crap code i’ve got going on right now at least its something in the meantime thoughhey 1bigwink i actually just started a new job so i haven’t had much time due to travel to set anything up back to my original proof of concept prebroken controller but as far as the device type code it’s actually just a smartapp code that i use and i’ve edited my original post to now include that so just importing that to your own app collection should enable the same functionality that i was able to create provided you configure everything correctly i can update again once i’ve gotten more time on my hands to integrate it all againalright after several months i’ve finally created a stepbystep video on how this whole system works r2d2 this hopefully clears up any confusion you had and should get you on your way to a reliable method to integrate your easybulbs to smartthings i’ve been using it reliably since my last post and have had no problems minus configuration issues android phone changing the ip address on me set it to a static ip and now that’s fixed routines not running due to my silly programming also fixed but otherwise the functionality of the http request to the android phone which triggers the automagic app to send udp commands through the milight controller is sound and working greatjust got smarttiles running and it works just as you would expect the one issue i pointed out in the latest video i created is if the light is altered by any other means wifi remote power loss etc then the current state will not sync simple way to restore it is to just toggle the switch on and off or off then on depending on how it was left and your current state should be correct i imagine a simple rule or routine could accomplish this but i just manually sync it when it occurs usually when i flip my breakers doing house maintenance and they automatically turn on with restored power let me know if you need any more helpthat would be great as i have made several failed attempts myself to integrate a few of my always on machines to control them however my programming knowledge stops at what i’ve selftaught myself so far i’m sure with enough time and patience i could probably figure out a device type as you suggested however for my purposes really all i needed was an automated way to turn them offon a few colors maybe and that was mostly it since i only have a few bulbs at the moment so at this point i’m mostly finished with developing i did discover a script that ran on linux which i could successfully implement however couldn’t integrate but with your knowledge you may be able to figure out a way i couldn’t here’s the link to the site i found and the scripts are easy to execute and the commands are essentially the same as the udp sender http://iqjar.com/jar/home-automation-using-the-raspberry-pi-to-control-the-lights-in-your-home-over-wi-fi/ i will make sure you’re aware that i’ve had no formal training outside 1 java class so my programming skills are rather lacking but i’d be happy to help testcollaborate with whatever you neednot to keep you in the dark for too long but i am working with a friend of mine who programs for a living and we are developing a node js server that will do exactly such a thing i will have to test it out on windows as it’s being designed for linux right now but either way there are efforts right now to create such a thing stay tuned i will post an update and walkthrough here soonhi sean yea i was aware of jared’s tcp solution which granted was more elegant in that it was two way communication as i understood it smartthings prerequesit for anything becoming official however what you’re experiencing is exactly what i was attempting to avoid having anything being routed outside of my network in general not to mention any potential lag to me was unacceptable i’m still working with my friend coincidentally also named jared no relation and hopefully in a few days time will have something to present as of right now there’s a crude version that hasn’t quite been field tested but is proven and we are working to get it as simple as possible so hopefully it reduces any possible hiccups for anyone to boil it down so you can get a preview of what’s to come he’s built a node server i’ve installed on my linux machine happens to be a kodibuntu and using a script i will link to once it’s all packaged together i found on another site that has basic milight functionality eliminating the need for an androidalright lads and lassies saddle your horses because it’s about to get real i have a cross platform solution that can be run independently and will integrate smartthings with milights limitless led etc etc it’s essentially a node server and my knowledge of it is fairly limited as i mentioned earlier i collaborated with my friend jared schraub that did all the coding for the server itself big shout out and thanks to him for his time spent and knowledge lent however i have enough of an understanding to hopefully stepbystep walk through installing everything to keep it simple i’m going to append the instructions for the new method to my original post so that way everything is in one place and quick and easy to access questions comments concerns suggestions are all welcome on this thread and i will do my best to be prompt in responsiveness but if things get fairly technical regarding the server itself fair warning that i may only be able to reply with a i will have to ask jared or i could google around for 10hrs but outside of that once it’s running you should be set some background for anyone that’s curious the node server’s original intent was to utilize the url trigger i’ve already created with my milight smartthings app and simply parse that into a shell command that would run a corresponding script i found online specifically for linux however in the process we discovered an api that basically combined everything we needed into one package that itself we used a node server so we would still have the shell command capability as well as it natively also does the mllight commands all from the url request so basically install my milight smartthings app define the parameters run the server and you can control all your lights on top of running whatever other scripts you wantdesire cheers',\n",

visit the website for more limitations you still need the api you can only cast drm free content using the presets due to the cast protocols design that will never change the api host proxy still needs a static ip address will change soon need help castweb help so you have a problem with castweb dont worry first check the faq then have a quick look at the smartthings community forum thread if you cannot find the answer there just signup and ask your question on the forum just open an screenshots dthstep2png1440×2560 142 kb dthstep1png1440×2560 174 kb dthstep3png1440×2560 150 kb groupsyncstep1png1440×2560 146 kb groupsyncstep2png1440×2560 249 kbno probably not only the google play music or pandora app can do that drm free means that you just have a plain mp3 filestream unless you can somehow get the mp3 or whatever url from google play or pandora you cannot cast it i’m not using these services but i think they require sign in good rule of thumb is if you cannot download it to a folder on your pc you cannot cast ityeah i know since google owns the protocol i guess they have a deal with the content providers to access there receiver apps casting roughly works like that you have the sender your mobile app and the receiver webapp executed on the cast device since the receivers are web apps they use the same kind of drm they use on their web app for your browser if you have the id of the receiver app you can probably get it to launch on your chromecast pandora ready to cast screen however everything after this point is up to pandora spotify google they’ll have some kind of login mechanism in place and one to authorizestartcontrol playback so even if you managed to reverse engineer one of these receiver’s it could break at any moment and maybe it’s even illegal and no i’m not an expert on that topic just what i’ve learned over the past couple of months really sorry to disappoint it just isn’t possible with the way the protocol is designedthanks posborne i didn’t even know st supported mdns i thought only ssdp worked for now if there really was mdns support device discovery could be handled directly from the hub there’s not much magic to it this would also remove the enormous dependencies for mdns in nodejs chromecast used to respond to ssdp in cast v1 but that is either not supported at all anymore or will be removed in the future the minimal requirements would be the ability to send tcpudp packages to a port directly without the http overhang and protobuff support according to the forum the first thing isn’t possible so i didn’t even bother trying to get protobuff to work someone who seems to have given up on his dth already pointed out there might be undocumented protobuff support in st but i didn’t check i will look into adding device discovery from the hub directly in the next couple of days running everything of the hub would be great but i can understand that direct connections tofrom the hub may not be a great thing for securityfor years sonos used to have custom apps for there speakers st at some point decided to make the methods etc sonos was using the standard for music players that’s why the sonos apps worked with most other speakers for voice notifications on speakers there used to be the sonos ‘notify by sound’ app a couple of months ago st just pulled it from the marketplace and ‘replaced’ it with there own ‘speaker companion’ app i implemented the methods they require for voice notifications according to there documentation but there new ‘replacment’ app just doesn’t recognize my dth i did some testing and changed i believe the name and other stuff to sonos and then i could select the speaker however it just didn’t work since they don’t release there code i have no clue what to implement in order to work with their speaker companion if you’d like to install the old sonos smartapps they are still available on github and as a template from the st ide they let you create voice notifications on cast devices set the volume etc so no need to buy sonos speakers just copy and paste the old source code into the ide and you can install these apps again and voice notifications will workno i haven’t just to clarify you can still cast from your phone or whatever to the chromecasts the dth will then display ‘plex’ the name title and whatever is available from plex in the device page see the screenshots of ‘kitchen’ for that in the first post you’ll be able to pauseplay set volumemute stop casting just like you’d with the google home app casting only non drm stuff just applies to the presets you own the content on your plex server and they have a web interface that lets you stream from the browser that means you should be able to somehow get a link to your movie or what you would like to set as a preset as long as you have a media url like http://myplexserver.lan/movies/greatestmovieever.mp4 that would play as a preset so it should be possible to set plex stuff as a preset just probably takes some time to get a direct url to the content on your plex serveryep seems like it’s the one i used the code from the stcommunity repo if you go up two directories you’ll also see the other sonos smartapps and the bose soundtouch smartapp the bose one let’s you control the presets and play at a certain volume every feature it offers works on the dthyes it will do that don’t forget you need to run a nodejs proxy somewhere on your network i wouldn’t recommend equipping your whole house with chromecasts because of my dth thoughedden in conjunction with the old sonos notify smartapp thanks to the awesome sbdobrescu the dth will soon work with the new speaker companion app as well st somehow move tts from one capability to the other fix was ridiculously easy will update

controllable and used in other apps this app is not affecting it at all3 i have added a simulated motion sensor just to see how it works it is listed with all other motion sensors when i click it it sends me text message but doesn’t affect lights at all platform issue timers aren’t firing to turn it off report it to st support or your switch is too far from the hub and isn’t communicating properly so the turn off command is getting lost don’t understand the question if why it isn’t communicating is the question it has nothing to do with the app that’s between the hub and device the app calls the platform api’s after that is’ upto the platform and hub again can’t say see ide live logging to note what’s going on all of the above sounds like a communication issue between your hub and light switch btw the ge light switches are very unreliable i’m constantly as in about once a month having to repair them since they stop communicating with the hubrabramov i can control all the above manually and with other applications flawlessly does not rule out a communication issue flashing is a very intense operation and the st and platform hub aren’t good with doing a series of short operations for multiple reasons the hub itself can’t handle series of short communications with devices as it doesn’t retry failed commands the platform timers don’t support short resolutions one way to test it to modify the code and change the timing to flash every say 5 seconds onoff change the onoff delay on lines 342 and 343 to 5000 this code was developed when the platform did respond to short operations but with the recent changes it just doesn’t allow for it reliably so maybe the feature should be dropped rabramov when a real motion sensor on the list is triggered i get the push message text message and the lights turns on 124 always when i turn onoff the simulated motion sensor i get the notification and text message but the lights never turns on can’t say don’t know how the simulated sensor code is written possibly it isn’t sending the required event notifications to st or more likely the communication with the switch is failing again the best way to see what’s going is to open the ide live logging and trace through what events are being received by the app and what commands the app is sending it logs everything in detail it should help you isolate where the issue in your setup might berabramov really appreciate your help support and advice anytime thanks for your supportintruder alert with alarms lights and camera pictures version 150 workaround for st bug with

but has the ability to do an http request you could expose an endpoint with this app send the request from your device and this app will propragate the event in the smartthing system flic button support this app has been optimized to work best with flic button you can see a step by step tutorial on how to set it up here https://community.smartthings.com/t/flic-button/62951 you will need to enable oauth support for this app to work a step by step instruction to do so can be found here https://community.smartthings.com/t/flic-button/62951 button support works well with flic button handler usage rest api on how to invoked it https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations//button///?access_token= installationid of your smartapp use https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/endpoints?access_token=bcea5b37-1868-4418-a131-3c82a2e9eb90 to find it out access token used for authentication this file has been truncated show original step 4 install and configure it you should now be able to see your newly created flic button from step 1 within the buttons section step 5 this app need oauth support click on my smartapps within from https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/apps and choose the new jbisson expose rest api click edit properties second icon step 6 under that page you’ll find an oauth section click and click enable oauth in smart app store the client id somewhere you’ll need it for the next step step 7 open a new browser tab and go to this address replace the cliend id part with the one you got from step 6 https://graph.api.smartthings.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=&scope=app&redirect_uri=www.blah123.com example would be https://graph.api.smartthings.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=38be8142-3572-407e-8959-34027e545811&scope=app&redirect_uri=www.blah123.com step 8 select your hub from the list and check the device handler flic button you have to give them access and click authorize at the bottom you’ll be redirected by a not found page this is normal look in the url you should see a code portion ie https://graph.api.smartthings.com/oauth/www.blah123.com?code=s6w514 note this code it will be used for the next step step 9 the last step require curl postman would work as well download a copy of curlexe for windows https://curl.haxx.se/download.html make sure you download one of the package for your platform open a command prompt and type this curl x post h contenttype applicationxwwwformurlencoded d granttypeauthorizationcodecodeclientidclientsecretredirecturiwww.blah123.com https://graph.api.smartthings.com/oauth/token header contenttype

header contenttype applicationxwwwformurlencoded make sure to replace the code by the code you got from step 8 your clientid as well as the clientsecret if everything works well you should get a response that look like this accesstoken99741db6285943ecac8c241a364a5516tokentypebearerexpiresin1576786529scopeapp the access token is really what we need for next step step 10 use a browser and go to https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/endpoints?access_token=bcea5b37-1868-4418-a131-3c82a2e9eb91 if this url doesn’t work use the one returned step 9 for regional api url make sure you replace with your access token this will give the url of the installationid within the uri body section at this point you should have a working public endpoint that look something like this https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations// login in your flic mobile application for each actions click double click hold choose the internet request and paste the url for your button the url will change based on which color you choose in step 1 the full url should look something like this for a turquise flic button and click event https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations/ba86d3a6-f498-4803-b503-abfd45e102b5/button/turquise/0/click?access_token=54cc5a76-53ac-5497-96ff-4846fbc02a11 note that you need to replace the accesstoken with the one you got form step 9 usage rest api on how to invoked it https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations//button///?access_token= installationid of your smartapp use https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/endpoints?access_token=bcea5b37-1868-4418-a131-3c82a2e9eb90 to find it out access token used for authentication step 9 color of your button if using the flic handler integration options are black white turquise green yellow button number identification used if you have more than one button with the same color action name command name that will be invoked if using the flic handler integration options are click doubleclick hold note that the id’s will be different in your case as well as the access token in order to validate that you have a working endpoint working use curl again open your flic device handler in your smartphone you should be able to control your flic button device handler by sending this curl x put h contenttype applicationxwwwformurlencoded d ‘’ https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations/a096c1ec-aa3e-41de-b5fa-cc39fabb3865/button/white/0/click?access_token=bcea5b37-1868-4418-a131-3c82a2e9eb90 header contenttype applicationxwwwformurlencoded again change your installationid and accesstoken with yours step 11 at this point you should have an endtoend working flic button when you click on it it should do a request to the expose api which then notify the flic button device handler for an event you could use core community’s own rule engine for defining your own rule ie when i click on my flicbutton do this ect release candidate core communitys own rule engine if you use core and using the flic button device handler the mapping between action and button numbers are as follow this will be very usefl if using core smartapps click event button1 pushed double click event button2 pushed hold event button3 pushed step 12 the last step is to link the url to the actual flic hardward device launch your flic android app click on your button and for a specific event click double click hold event add an http internet request and insert the url on step 5 in the put section the url will look like this https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations//button///?access_token= the endtoend should be working now when you’ll press on the flic button it will contact your phone or your tablet through bluetooth the app will invoke the smartthing rest api endpoint the rest api endpoint will notify the flic button device handler and there all your rules and logic associated with the flic button will apply this give a tons of possibility to trigger all kind of thing related the the flic button enjoyexactly the flic doesn’t have any wifi connectivity so your phone and tablet will act as a gateway to the cloud i have a tablet that sit near and act as a gateway between bluethooth and wifi in an ideal world flic button should be zwave so it could talk directly to the hub andor hub having bluethooth capability directly but for now it is what it is it seems to work very well the way it isbrenttron fredrik yeah my initial instruction was not that clear i tried to put more detail on them let me know if you are stuck somewhere and you need more help to get goingjaaks i’m assuming you are at step 10 correct could you tell me which url you are trying to use it should look like this one https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/installations/ba86d3a6-f498-4803-b503-abfd45e102b5/button/turquise/0/click?access_token=54cc5a76-53ac-5497-96ff-4846fbc02a11jaaks my badthere is another step that you needed to do i will udpate my steps but basically you need to do this https://graph.api.smartthings.com/api/smartapps/endpoints?access_token=bcea5b37-1868-4418-a131-3c82a2e9eb91 and this will give you the url for your endpoint in the uri section just that take link and append the button sectioni forgot i changed the smart app from get to a put so you’ll need to use curl to trigger it the url is good just need to use a put try this curl x put h contenttype

smartthings routines and automations check out my virtual device sync smartapp try the virtual device sync app that is mentioned in the postalright i just released an update that should have everything working you were right about the change mentioned and a lot of other updates needed to be made smartthings seems to be really sluggish lately or maybe it is just me commands are taking a lot of time to get from device to being processed and it is throwing off testingwhen you say the energy report is missed are you seeing it in the log but it is not updating the child device what are your reporting intervals for channel 1 and channel 2 also what is your reporting interval for the last two power energy options i really don’t understand the difference between the last two and the channel options the controller sends channel 1 power energy stats twice once as a multichannel command and once as a meter command and channel 2 power energy once as a multichannel command i believe the last two options are regarding the meter commands for channel 1 but that is totally redundant so i changed them back to the default of 3600 and have the channel reports coming much more often i expected the controller to send cumulative reports as a meter report but it never does i have to tally the cumulative manually in the handler i also believe that this device does respond well when sending multiple commands to it while it is sending commands to the hub the device was not responding to several commands so i added a delay between some of them which seems to have helpedi’m reading through the manual and i think ultimately i need clarification on what the power energy parameters do my theory right now is that 58 59 set an interval for both channels the ch1 and ch2 specific parameters set conditions that must be met in order for 58 59 to actually send a report it kind of makes sense and seems like it is how it is working but clarification would be greatwow great information i will definitely check this out thanksclassicgod so i have tried out your recommendations and they work exactly how you have described i am confused about how one thing is working though i cross referenced what you posted as the multichannelassociationset nodeid with the link you posted you list nodeid 0zwavehubnodeid1 the link mentions an initial nodeid followed by a zero 0 marker followed by pairs of nodeid endpoints so i am guessing that by ommiting the initial nodeid you are specifying not to send nonendpoint reports since we are only concerned about the endpoints then you are telling the device to associate the smartthings hub with endpoint 1 which tells the device to send switchbinaryreport and meterreports encapsulated from endpoint 1 but shouldn’t endpoint 2 be in there as well ie 0zwavehubnodeid1zwavehubnodeid2 it is sending reports from endpoint 2 so i guess there must be something i am missing also why is it required to remove the initial association with the hub if there is a regular association for the group does it take precedence over the mutlichannel onei did finally push the updates that classicgod recommended i have found them to be a more efficient way to communicate with the device and most likely how fibaro meant for the device to be programmed if you do update to this version hit the configure button afterwards to make sure the proper associations get set',\n",
       " 'i am using smartthings hub primarily for a new installation of 100 fibaro light switches dimmers and nondimmers in my house i did some initial testing of a few fibaro switches which seemed to work fine my next milestone was to install an entire room guest house with about a dozen fibaro switches they all work fine individually and can be invoked from the physical switch or remotely via the smartthings app using classis app alexa etc they do however exhibit intermittent delays in reporting their status to the app sometimes it is immediate while other times it takes anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute my next step was to test some scenes and automations for example i would create a scene that turned on or off multiple fibaro switches i would then create an automation that invoked such a scene when the physical fibaro switch was turned on or off eg press one light switch which causes 2 or 3 circuits to turn on this is where i experienced an unusual amount of delay and often partial failure eg only 2 of 4 switches would turn on i was surprised that the scenes in the smartthings app which invoke multiple devices seem to work significantly more slowly than the individual switches themselves for example i can tell alexa to turn on a fibaro switch or invoke the fibaro swtich remotely from the smartthings app with little delay and i can turn on the physical switch and see it reported in the smartthings app with relatively little delay but when i invoke a scene from the smartthings app or an automation triggered by the operation of a physical swtich which invokes multiple switches then i get significantly more delay and often a partial failure if i wait 15 seconds and reinvoke the scene it might invoke some of the switches it missed the first time though even this is not terribly reliable does the smartthings app have a general problem with scenes that invoke multiple devices eg 310 at a time is this likely a smartthings problem or perhaps a fibaro problem i still need to do more troubleshooting to narrow this down and hopefully find a solution but appreciate any thoughts – especially from someone who has used fibaro light switches with the smartthings hubdo you also find that the reporting eg whether a device state is on or off is rather inconsistent sometimes it is slow to update eg range from 1 second to 30 seconds while other times it never updates unless you force a state change remotely from the app or directly from the device have you done more detailed troubleshooting or found someone technical at samsung to talk to about thisi will give this a try and share my experience thanks again for the detailed explanation and the samplesi too am waiting for my promised callback from tier 2 on these issues i have a v2 hub now very hesitant to upgrade and see no reason to i am in early stages of troubleshooting delays with scenes and automations but will soon try webcore for comparison though i am new to troubleshooting the logs i wish there was a way to troubleshoot zwave as well eg something akin to traceroute for ip so that i could see the route of each command instead of just the status ifwhen it reaches the hub does anyone know if such a zwave traceroute tool exists that would help me understand the role if any distance is playing in these problems for example i have a guest house with about a dozen fibaro light switches but there is a single long hop about 30 feet between the guest house and main house where the hub lives if delays were consistent that would be one thing but things generally seem to work with minimal delay however i am also experiencing intermittent delays and partial failures eg 2 of 4 lights in a scene failing to turn onoff sometimes i continue to bug samsung and hope to hear back from tier 2 soon and will report what i learn if anything',\n",

a smart switch 3way configuration a smaller charge is looped through the addon switch some things to know 3way wiring for smart switches is different than standard 3 way wiring you cannot use dumb 3way switches with smart switches you must purchase the matching ge addon switch to wire with your ge smart master switch if the line is wired into the light fixture you will not be able to use ge smart switches in a 3way configuration without running additional wires there are other smart options available listed below recommendations before beginning always power off your circuit breaker before working with electricity only a tenth of an amp can kill please do not use ground as a neutral you may end up with a current where it does not belong and it is against code take pictures of the existing wiring before starting those pictures are a good reference point and can assist those giving advice in the community the community is a great place to ask questions or advice purchase a multimeter or power wand to help determine which wires are line load traveler and neutral existing wiring configurations can come in all shape and sizes usage of colors may not be standard if you don’t feel comfortable with any of this hire a professional note there is now a zwave plus ge dimmer model 14299 that does not need neutrals it will not work with leds and is only designed for

faq so you want an automated hardwired light switch but you’re not sure where to start well you’re in the right place the most common requirement of any hardwired automated light switch is a neutral wire yes there are a fewread very very very few switches that don’t require a neutral but those will limit you to incandescent only for those of us using led fluorescent or some other energy efficient bulbs under 20w a neutral is required so what does this look like image this is a diagram of a switch with the neutral run directly to the light this is not good for automated hardwired light switchs and i would highly recommend that if you want to automate the light contact an electrician and have them pull a neutral for you it’s not as expensive as you think and will save you wiring

version 20 which are wired the same as dumb 3way switches they are available in paddle and toggle formats obviously as mentioned above your wiring may still differ from these common 3way wiring standards feel free to ask any questionsif anyone has some comments or corrections please let me know i will try to continue to add other wiring configurations that pop up and link to those discussionsthe ones i have listed as only option can only be wired that one way unless you run additional wiring i will also look at those other optionsi will have to think about it 4way has a lot of different wiring optionsyes that sounds exactly right as you have deduced it appears that either wire set 1 or 3 is your power from breaker line and neutral the other must continue the circuit to power some other device wire set 2 is your load and wire set 4 is your connection to the other switch box',\n",

       " 'releasing an app i developed for myself called thermostat manager thermostat manager is similar to and could be considered an alternative to thermostat mode director why originally i went with thermostat mode director which was available from within the smartthings app but over time i found thermostat mode director to be buggy and unreliable what’s the same •mode adjusting thermostat manager will change the mode heat to cool cool to heat of your thermostat based on userdefined thresholds in a similar manner as thermostat mode director originally i was hoping to have this app set modes based on the setpoints that you set on your thermostat you know the values that you set on the thermostat itself and can also set in your hello home i’m home functions but at least in my case i discovered that the thermostat only remembers the setpoint for the mode it is currently in i have a zen for those interested but this app will be fine for about any thermostat anyway i ended up having to go with the same model that thermostat mode director uses you set upper and lower limits btw thermostat manager is not a rework of thermostat mode director i’ve seen a couple of these in the forums and they don’t ever seem to be any good •notifications thermostat manager has text notifications that are similar to thermostat mode director’s but the content of thermostat manager’s notifications is more dynamic also they only occur if the user enables them and then they are only sent if a command is sent to the thermostat change in modetemperature etc thermostat manager also adds optional push notifications •can use remote temperature sensors although i generally recommend using your thermostat as your temperature sensor there are unusual situations in which you may benefit from using a remote temperature sensor users can select any temperature reporting device and use it to base thermostat manager’s decisions on such as mode changes please note that the thermostat still uses its own internal thermometer to decide when to start blowing air this feature will work in the same manner as it does in thermostat mode director what’s different •user friendly i designed my app to be more readable with help tips on settings that aren’t selfexplanatory •completely configurable it is chock full of options there’s an enabledisable slider for every capability so that you don’t have to deconfigure it in order to disable it temporarily •optional smart home monitor based setpoint enforcement thermostat manager adds the capability to enforce thermostat setpoints based on smart home monitor security modes generally i find it annoying when an app tries to override manual settings but i discovered that some situations can occur where the thermostat will change modes to a setpoint that was set a long time ago that doesn’t fit what we want currently if this happens when you’re not home it could be a problem for your pets or your electronics so i made my system minimally invasive it will only enforce the setpoints if smart home monitor based setpoint enforcement is configured and enabled and then only if there is a mode change cool to heat heat to cool •the energy saving turnoffthethermostatwhenthedoorsareopen thing in this app actually works and it’s also completely optional it has the same configuration as thermostat mode director but this one will actually work if you use it and when you close the doors the thermostat will pop back on and set the mode it is was in before the thermostat was turned off •bonus i have a particular family member who likes to go to the thermostat and change the fan mode from auto to on if i don’t notice this a lot of energy money can be wasted therefore i built in an optional slider that enforces fan mode auto on the thermostat in case you have any wacky household members like me what’s new •by request i’ve added the ability to override thermostat manager by manually setting the thermostat to off mode if the allow manual thermostat off to override thermostat manager slider is enabled thermostat manager will essentially be disabled when someone manually turns off the thermostat temperature changes will be ignored and modes and setpoints will not be set if you prefer that thermostat manager reenable cooling or heating mode when someone manually turns off the thermostat and the temperature rises or falls below one of the manually configured thresholds then leave the slider in disabled mode •by request i’ve added the option to use emergency heat mode in place of heat mode if you would like to do this go to the emergency heat settings page and enable the always use emergency heat mode instead of heat mode slider this may come in handy if your hvac unit is malfunctioning •by request i’ve added the ability to enable emergency heat based on the temperature reading of an external temperature sensor these settings can be found in the emergency heat settings thermostat manager users who live in cold areas had complained that it takes too long to wait for the thermostat to enable emergency heat by itself based on the thermostat’s internal temperature readings •by request i’ve added an optional holddown timer for the energy saver system if specified or set to a value other than zero energy saver will now pause for a user specified minimum number of minutes before being allowed to turn the thermostat back on after all of the doors are closed the setting has a default value if you do not wish to use it just set it to 0 these settings can be found under the energy saver settings page •tm now has the ability to enforce temperature setpoints this means that if this ability is enabled even if someone manually changes the temperature tm will change it back to the setpoint you have specified in tm •as many have requested i’ve added in an optional a holdafter timer option to the energy saver feature if set the holdafter timer will hold the thermostat in a paused status for a specified number of minutes after all contacts have been closed this timer works in conjunction with the holddown timer which is configured using the setting minimum pause time if both are set tm will use whichever timer takes the longest to complete •i finally decided to add the ability to use a remote temperature sensor using the thermostat as your temperature sensor is recommended for most situations however i have found some unusual cases in which it can be useful to have a remote temperature sensor albeit one that is not fully functional as i have mentioned before ‘unless you have an ecobee the thermostat uses its own internal thermometer to control the hvac unit even if we manually set the mode to heat for example the heat won’t kick on unless the thermostat’s internal thermometer says that it is below the thermostat’s heating setpoint’ that having been said there are situations in which one may want to have the modes controlled by a remote temperature sensor even though the hvac won’t kick on until the thermostat’s internal thermometer has reached configured setpoints on its own future additions •i’ve had a request to add support for multiple thermostats this will be done but it requires some indepth changes and it may be a while until it gets added until then there is no problem running multiple instances of thermostat manager i always perform my own testing before i publish a new version but i also rely on you to report any problems please let me know if you notice that anything isn’t working right feel free to make further recommendations for changes or additions as i continue

left open for 1 min nexxman to access the debugging log access the smartthings ide at https://account.smartthings.com/ then click on the live logging link at the top of the page i will take a look at the honeywell system and see if there are any issues that might cause this to happen in the meantime i suggest trying changing the minutes left open to 2 minutes instead of 1 minute just as a test let me know if you have any luck with that if you do i will know what code to look atspurkat thermostat manager shuts off when the door opens but does not turn it back on when it’s closed spurkat that’s an interesting problem i will look at incorporating time of day settings into the app 1st try turning on debug logging and perform the test again what mode does the debug log say that your thermostat is in is it something other than heat or cool maybe it says thermostat manager mode auto when you close the doors you should see something in the logs like thermostat manager all contacts have been closed restoring cooling mode if you see that log entry but the thermostat isn’t coming on that’ll help me figure it out what kind of thermostat are you using edit i may have guessed your problem you are using thermostat manager in conjunction with thermostat mode director right thermostat mode director likes to set auto mode sometimes thermostat manager tends to ignore that mode because it is somewhat ambiguous and its behavior varies from device to device thinking of this exposed a loophole in my design that i didn’t intend i have just patched this and uploaded an updated source code that should take care of this possibility should it arise give the new code a try and let me know if that solves your issue if not try the suggestions above and let me know how it goesdgjorgjievski i also see problem when the device needs to switch off because of open door window dgjorgjievski thank you and thank you for posting the logs it appears that you’ve discovered a typo in my code that was causing a problem to happen i have corrected the code and you shouldn’t have any problems now let me know if i can be of further assistancedgjorgjievski hello again make sure you’re using the latest revision i also changed something else in the app in particular the build number is 2018040102 and line 218 should look like this def opencontact contactcurrentvaluecontactcontainsopen i will take a look at some of your suggestions the toggle widget isn’t a bad idea as far as further setpoint settings i am looking at making some enhancements in this area but there are so many situations that people have it is difficult to come up with one that suits everyone but i will continue to work on it on 3 i should be able to do this with little difficulty i will take a look at it on number 4 this may be already possible depending on your meaning if you don’t want any thermostat mode changes to occur just set your thresholds to zero 0 if you set it at zero that particular threshold will be ignored and heatcool will not be set based on it if you’re talking about overriding the thermostat temperature by setting the temperature manually you can already do this as well the setpoints are only set when a thermostat mode change takes place cool to heat heat to cool etc the reason it works like this is because i wanted to be able to maintain manual functionality as much as possible but i also discovered that sometimes when a mode change occurs unusual things can happen for example say during winter you have your thermostat set to 65f for heating 79 for cooling while not home for example but then summer comes around and to save money you want it set at 73 for cooling well when the mode change occurs while you aren’t home it takes the value that you set it at last which could have been months ago if this is a house that you only reside at 6 months out of the year or you are on vacation and are not home this could be a problem your electronics may overheat or any animals in the house may end up getting very hot at 79f it’s a bit of a safeguard it is possible to disable these by disabling setpoint enforcement however another alternative is to experiment with mode rules at the bottom of the settings you will see options for set for specific modes you could try creating various instances for various modes thanks your thoughts i am always open to input and will continue looking at expanding flexibilitydgjorgjievski i just realised that the setpoint is not sent when the alarm status is changed dgjorgjievski have you tried using the hello home i’m back goodbye etc tiles to set the temperaturesecurity mode that’s what most people do they are more convenient because you can set multiple settings with one button you can also make widgets out of themnexxman i took a look at the honeywell wifi code and didn’t see anything that should cause a problem i recently released a new version of thermostat manager that has a couple of fixes in it make sure you are using the latest revision 2018040102 just in case this may solve your problem did you see anything in the debug logs if you haven’t done it yet just turn on debug logging log into the smartthings ide click on live logging and then run a test by opening and closing some doors over a period of minutes copy and paste the logs here and that will help me find the problemhald do i have to create an instance of the app for each thermostat i don’t see any way to select multiple thermostats for one instance of the app currently yes i only have a single thermostat home with which to perform testing and i generally don’t like to implement anything that i can’t test it is not a difficult thing to setup multiple instances but if you would like to use the same settings for the 3 thermostats i could work with you to modify the system to allow for multiple thermostats if you could do the testing for me and report back the results i’d be willing to make the modifications hald is that what the cooling threshold and heating threshold settings do or are those inside temperatures as reported by the thermostats cooling and heating thresholds are user defined variables that define when thermostat manager will send a command to the thermostat to switch modes for example a cooling threshold of 76f will tell thermostat manager to send a command to your thermostat to switch it into cooling mode if it is not in cooling mode already so that it will start cooling your house at a temperature above 76f a heating threshold of 68f will tell thermostat manager to switch to heating mode if the temperature falls below 68f hald how do i create something that will react to external temperature the short answer is you can’t that is unless the thermostat you have came with a system that includes remote sensors like an ecobee or your thermostat allows you use other thermostats as remote sensors the reason for this is that although we may have something like a smartthings temperature sensor readily available for reporting the temperature in a given area your thermostat uses its own internal thermometer to decide whether or not to activate for example you could have an outside sensor report that it is 90f outside and then have an app tell the thermostat to switch to cool mode based on that report but the thermostat’s internal thermometer will read the temperature of its own area in this case let’s say its 75f if your cooling setpoint is 76f the ac won’t kick on because the thermostat’s internal thermometer says that it doesn’t need to it will be set to cooling mode as instructed by the app but the ac won’t kick on the only way around this would be to use an app that automatically adjusts the cooling and heating setpoints in order to make the unit kick on when you want it to thermostat manager wasn’t designed to work like this and so i won’t be implementing this feature but smartthings already has an app in their library that does this called keep me cozy if i remember right and you should be able to use it in combination with thermostat manager an alternative method to achieve 1 on your wish list may be to simply use a smartthings tile you should be able to create a simple button that sets all 3 thermometers relatively easily using this method but if you do want to add the capability for thermostat manager to control multiple thermostats let me know and i will work with you on thatpacman45 i was wondering if there is an option or could there be an option to have the thermostat manager switch the thermostat from heat to emerg heat when the outside air temperature as measured either from an outdoor sensor or from the cloud was below 30 degrees or some selectable setpoint thermostat manager does not currently have this functionality but something like this is possible i would not be able to test this modification myself as i do not have a unit that has an emergency heat mode but i would be willing to make these modifications if you wouldn’t mind testing them and reporting the results to me this seems like a desirable feature',\n",

supported are presence and welcome devices for taking snaphots motion detection and person presence presence camera welcome camera presence device welcome preferences presence preferences respond in this thread with any issues questions or suggested functionality there’s already quite a bit of manhours in this project so if you’d like to support me any donations are welcome via https://www.paypal.me/nickveenstra i plan on supporting this as long as i have a hub and since this is the best ha device i’ve owned so far that could be a while things that should work updated 22 jan 2018 motion detection with webhook enabled for presence and welcome devices human animal and vehicle detection for presence devices these activate the same way as a motion detector a preferences setting can set each of these categories to also trigger the general motion detector for use in other smartappsdevices taking a snapshot if camera ip and secret have been setup ok for both types taking a snapshot every x minuteshours for both types person presence for welcome camera’s updated every 5 minutes or persons arriving via face recognition instantly via the webhook people leaving is done via timeout of people not seen for x hours set in the netatmo app this comes in via the 5 minute poll in each person device there’s a button to set the specific person as having left and in the welcome camera interface all available persons can be set to away show home name in presence welcome and person devices things that would be niceuseless but funny take snapshot when doorbell pressed count the number of cars and pets going past the presence camera’s no idea what else to do with pets and cars any other implementation ideas are very welcome we have 2 people here in the house for which i have an arrival sensor and netatmo person so it would be interesting to mix the two types of data to get more accuracy somehowhi joe i’ve released an initial version the code see the link in the first post for setup instructions i’m interested to hear what people think and what we could do with these devices i still need to work on a nicer tile design but i’d like to test functionality firstpaulreynolds i have the ip and access key added but there is always an error message to set ip and secret in preferences first coming from the top banner you have to add the ip and key in each camera preferences if either is missing you receive this message paulreynolds i do not appear to be picking up any motion from the device in smartthings but alerts from natatmo app are coming as expected please look at what the live logging is saying for the smartapp and paste some of the incoming webhook text here i have been coding all morning so please update the smartapp and devices first only if your security app has been configured correctly for notifications you should see things like cant deliver event no child device active for camera debug webhook message motion detected by if you get the webhook message that means something is incoming but the message relates to a specific camera if that camera is not activated in the smartapp it can’t be delivered as shown in this exampleno child found for camera means that the presence you selected in the smartapp preferences wasnt created as a device there sometimes is bug during setup still looking for the cause but you should get a red error popup message then please remove the smartapp verify that your presence device is gone then install the smartapp again authenticate with netatmo and on the next screen do not add anything yet just save you go out to the smartapps overview again enter the smartapp again and then add your presence should work that way also i’m now realising that only the welcomes have a motion event the presence has human vehicle and car seen events i need to make some prefs to decide what people want to count as motion i guessi fixed the issue and added human animal and vehicle detection to the presence deviceafter a few days the devices get unstable i think it has to do with the runin that i use to undo the motion will replace it with an alternativeyeah sorry i need to make an instruction with images at some point haven’t had the time to do that yet you should have a camera device for each camera you activate in the smart app preferences in the camera device preferences the ip secret needs to be added it’s better to do that via the ide where you can edit the device preferences as well it’s easier to copy paste on a pcno the string with the two comma’s isn’t the one you need theres a string before that one after the ip bit watch the slashes carefullyok the instructions now come with images

       " 'i have had several request about how i map my zigbee network with digi’s xctu software so i thought i would share a quick how to caution this is not a digi supported procedure if something goes wrong during the firmware upgrade you could brick your digi usb xstick and have to send it back to digi to be recovered what is this and why would you want to do it zigbee mesh networks are self configuring and self healing and in larger networks it helps to know what nodes are routing who’s information you can’t really control the network configuration but it helps to see the relationship between your nodes if your troubleshooting a connection problem the screen capture below is how my smartthings zigbee network looks when it is mapped out by the xctu software the smartthings hub is the red c coordinator and the other devices with an r are zigbee routers and e are zigbee end nodes if i log into my smartthings ide and look at my devices under the zigbee id column i can lookup each device’s zigbee address for example the end node device 000d6f00032a0f17 is my smartsense openclosed sensor and i can see it is connected directly to the smartthings hub with good signal strength capturejpg1144×783 889 kb what this isn’t this is not a zigbee protocol analyzer you can not see the zigbee traffic between your nodes it simply maps out the routing table held by each zigbee device on your network protocol analyzers are expensive and give you massive amounts of information that is really only useful to a device engineer or low level programmer this is also not going to tell you one single thing about your zwave network there is a fair chance a lot of your devices are zwave so don’t expect it to map those devices setting it all up you will need a windows workstation with an available usb port in my case i’m using windows 7 but i think it will work on 10 you need to buy a digi usb dongle and download and install the xctu application the usb dongle will be sent to you with a generic configuration and the smartthings hub will not allow it to join the network it must be configured with the proper security settings and the correct trust center link key for the zigbee home automation profile once the usb dongle has the correct configuration the smartthings hub will allow it to join as a thing here are the steps at a high level install your xctu software and plug in your usb dongle open the xctu program and click on the scan icon to find your usb dongle you will need to make sure the radio firmware on the usb dongle is set to xb24zb zigbee router api 23a7 as shown below capturejpg739×677 82 kb once the firmware update is complete you will now need to update the security settings of the radio so it is compatible with smartthings download the xml configuration file form my coopboss.com web site and copy it to your local hard drive now click on load configuration file the little down arrow by the person icon and write it to your usb dongle by clicking on the pencil icon open your zigbee network for joining by going to smartthings on your smartphone and click on connect new device at this point your usb dongle is looking for a valid zigbee home automation network to join and you can see the status of this quest by scrolling down to the diagnostic commands and look at the ai association indication parameter you should see a 21 or 23 or ff they all basically say it is looking for a network to join when it reads 0 you have joined a valid zigbee network and can start mapping out the nodesit is possible for a mains powered device zigbee router to use source routing when sending a zigbee packet a source routed packet includes the entire route the packet should traverse to get from source to destination however that is done at the packet level by the device this is usually for very special use cases and the change has to be made in the firmware of the device the xctu program is pretty passive it just reads the routing tables of the zigbee routers it can’t be used to redefine your routing as a side note the smartthings hub uses manytoone routing it periodically broadcast a packet that triggers all zigbee routers to update their routing table with the most efficient route to the hub this insures all zigbee routers have a fresh accurate route to the hub in my experience smartthings has nailed the zigbee routing my network has been rock solid zigbee end nodes battery powered devices don’t do any routing or know anything about the network’s routes they simply know who their parent is zigbee router or coordinator and connect to it to send and receive data if they can’t connect to their parent or their parent has orphaned them because they didn’t check in they will have to reconnect sometimes if two zigbee routers are close to the same child it may jump back and forth between the two routers when it reconnects the trick here is to not make it go through a reconnect process if it does it usually isn’t a problem your network typology will just change when it moves from one router to another however a child device that has to reconnect often will have poor battery life i’m curious why do you want to change your zigbee routingno i don’t i have seen that on my network too i suspect it has something to do with the location of your usb fob in respect to the end nodes the nodes that don’t show up on my map are connected to zigbee routers that are more than one hop away from my usb fob it also seems to report more of them over time it would take a sniffer to really see what is going on i mostly use it to map my routers and to troubleshoot devices i’m working onthe formation of the zigbee network has nothing to do with the manytoone routing packet that is sent out by the coordinator the goal of a manytoone route packet is to make sure the routers have a fresh route to the hub what that route is depends on how the zigbee network is formed here is a screen shot of two many to one route request packets broadcast by my hub they were one minute apart that’s just an observation on my network i’m not saying everyone’s hub does the same thing i just know both my hubs v1 and v2 send these packets out ashutosh1982 should see the same thing ashutosh if you get a chance click on the terminal tab of the xctu and start recording packets you will receive all packets that are sent as broadcast i’m curious if you get the same many to one route request i see capturejpg1281×923 97 kbi would focus on your spruce router at 0x000d6f0002c8375c first it looks like it has a lot of connections as well as the two sensors i wonder if the sensors are on the fringe of coverage and the router is not being very attentive to them i would try having these devices connect to another zigbee router you could try turning off the spruce router and see if another router is withing range and will pickup up the two end devices if that doesn’t work you could move your smartthings hub closer to the two end devices and test jd brings up a good point on the cree bulb but if you were having problems with it the spruce irrigation device would be having problems as wellnikhilupadhyay once you get your xbee connected to the smartthings ha network following the steps outlined in the above thread your journey has just begun from high level to get your device to register itself with smartthings it should follow these steps your device sends a device announce to the hub when powered on see zdo cluster 0x0013 for details smartthings receives the device announce and sends packets querying your device for a list of end points and supported clusters see zdo clusters 0x0005 and 0x0004 for details your device responds to the above request with a list of end points and supported clusters zdo cluster 0x8005 and 0x8004 should be sent in response to the two packets sent in step 2 above smartthings uses this list of supported clusters and endpoints to match your device to a device type that has a matching footprint if smartthings finds a footprint match it will add it to your device with the name associated to the matching device type if there is not a match smartthings will add your device as a thing so if your not following the above steps that is why your device is not showing up in your my devices section of the ide to send commands to other devices you use zigbee cluster commands they are outlined in the zigbee cluster library at zigbee.org resources to send zigbee device object zdo commands with an xbee see the zdo transmissions section on page 84 of the xbee’s manual you can find more information on zdo commands in the zigbee specification to send public zigbee cluster commands see the section sending public profile commands with the api on page 179 of the xbee’s manual for a complete listing of public cluster commands see the zigbee cluster library specification as you can see this is not a trivial process and the first step may be to create a c library you can call to send the packets to the xbee are you sure an xbee is the right chip for you i think dresdenelektronik in germany may have a solution based on their radio with a zigbee library ready to go another route you may want to explore is to talk to the smartthings hub over wifi instead of zigbee zigbee is designed for small devices that normally don’t have a operating system like a piman did i

https://github.com/gnieboer/pellabridge here’s the readme from the repo pella insynctive smartthings integration version 100 this a project to bring integration of the pella insynctive system into smartthings the zwave capability of the bridge is currently not compatible with the st hub at least as far as i’ve been able to accomplish the bridge can be paired but the devices themselves which should pass through the bridge to the hub can not instead this project uses the wired interface to accomplish the same objective it is not a simple setup however the bridge uses telnet on port 23 to accept a single connection and sendreceive commands st cannot connect directly to a tcp socket so this integration requires a rest proxy docker container to accept calls over http and convert them to raw tcp and vice versa if you are not familiar with docker containers and using putty to connect to devices this integration might be a challenge there is a tamper warning if the cover of the door sensors is removed the up and down commands for the shades will send them to the user programmed open and close positions the full set of commands is in the device handler code and could be implemented if the user wants something different but i kept the dh interface simpler based on my preception of real user needs limitationsissues pella blindshades have not yet been tested with a real

battery level 4 5 readings which eventually disappear these appear to be coming from the pella bridge itself i have little time to provide any kind to troubleshooting technical support for this image pull requests are welcome installation step 1 ensure the bridge is not paired to your zwave hub a factory reset is not sufficient test when the bridge is unpluggedreplugged the blue light should flash after the green light comes on step 2 pair the bridge with the pella devices in the no home automation mode use the instructions for the pella bridge product guide and the product guides for each of the compatible products note that if you have previously tried to pair the bridge to your hub you will need to specifically unpair the device a factory reset does not accomplish this range is not as critical for pairing as it is for zwave the pella devices use 433mhz and have better range but no mesh network so in a normal sized house bridge placement should not be a major issue test when the doorlock is toggled the bridge should chime assume you haven’t specifically turned the chime off with the dip switches step 3 change the ip address to the bridge the default ip is 192168100121 plus bridge into your lan and use putty not windows telnet to telnet into the device you should see pella insynctive bridge as a banner on connect enter the following command bridgesetip192168000002 obviously use your preferred lan ip address note the leading zeros this ip will persist after a factory reset test reset device and connect to it via putty enter the following command to check the number of paired devices matches pointcount the number returned should equal the number of devices paired in step 2 disconnect from the bridge step 4 install proxy container the proxy is a net core linux container and requires two environment variables to be set during container creation hubipaddress the ip address of the smartthings hub bridgeipaddress the ip address set in the previous step ensure the addresses will both be reachable from the proxy they need not be on the same subnet if you have a segmented lan but do not expose the address to the internet as the bridge has no security and therefore the proxy does not either the proxy connects to the bridge on port 23 connects to the hub on 39500 and receives from the hub on the port of your choice 32781 by default command below so those ports need to be open use the following to pull the image from docker hub and get it running on the server of your choice or the equivalent in your favorite docker gui docker pull gcndevelopmentpellabridge docker run name pellabridge env hubipaddress1921680100 env bridgeipaddress1921680101 p 3278180 gcndevelopmentpellabridge the proxy will immediately connect so ensure you have disconnected from any manual connections you have made the container should gracefully handle tcp connection issues including bridge power offsdisconnects it will complain in the console window but should eventually reconnect it will keep the connection alive with a 4 minute ping which is therefore the longest window in which a push notification from the bridge might be missed test go to a browser and check http://your.proxy.ip:32781/api/pellabridge expected response json hello world http://your.proxy.ip:32781/api/pellabridge/status expected response versiona58mac00xxxxxxxxxxconnecttime20200606t20193829918760000ip1921680101 or similar watch the console output of the container to see the data being transmitted as expected for the second command step 5 from the groovy subdir install the device handlers you have physically as well as the pella insynctive bridge smart app test make sure you can see them in your ide step 6 configure the bridge in the app enter the proxy’s ip address not the bridge and port and the enter next the app will query the proxy and get information all the devices and install them once you see the number of devices installed click save the device will have preferences populated you should not have a need to change them unless you move the hub or reprogram devices though it may be simpler to just delete them all and reconfigure the smartapp the bridge itself will not appear as a device since it really has no function beyond enabling the connections test observe that the number of installed devices matched expectations step 7 devices of the same type will all have the same name you will have to figure out which is which and rename as appropriate test you are now complete ensure that the device are

       " 'woo hoo i got a cheap 32 fire tv at black friday it doesn’t have as many voice commands as the fire tv cube but i just wanted an additional tv for our guestroom the tv is fine the voice commands work fine but there’s no way to turn it on or off just by voice or turn it onoff with an automation so it’s a lot like the very expensive samsung smart televisions that way amazon.com amazon.com toshiba 32lf221u19 32inch 720p hd smart led tv fire tv edition amazon.com toshiba 32lf221u19 32inch 720p hd smart led tv fire tv edition electronics i knew it could be done by adding a harmony but i didn’t want to spend that much money and it seems like overkill since once the tv was on i was going to do everything by voice with the fire tv options i just needed a way to turn it on by voice as it happened i already had a switchbot hub plus which is used to control robot finger actuators in other parts of the house so i was thinking about just getting another actuator and adding it to the manual button on the tv but then i realized that the switchbot hub plus model has an ir blaster built into it so i decided to try that one of the reasons i like switchbot is that it already has integrations with echo google home ifttt and as of november 2019 smartthings so i tried it and it works great no special coding no custom code no man in the middle server just add the tv to the switchbot app add the switchbot integration in the new v3 smartthings app create a toggle scene in the switchbot app have alexa discover the scene and i’m all set totally handsfree voice control through echo to turn the tv on and then use my fire tv commands plus the option to do other smartthings integrations if i choose the integration for this particular model for any other tv commands would be fairly clunky because it’s at the button push level but it could be done for a television which has a better integration like the samsung models this should solve the problem of i can do everything except turn the tv on problem and again to do this you don’t actually need one of the button pusher devices you just need the cloud hub which lists for 49 on amazon or the micro hub which lists for 39 but you will have to supply your own power cord amazon.com amazon.com switchbot thermometer hygrometer alexa iphone android wireless buy switchbot thermometer hygrometer alexa iphone

thanks to johnconstantelo who pointed out below that the newest model of the switchbot hub is smaller and sells for 10 less although you have to provide your own power cord as i mentioned i’ve had mine for a while and it’s the 49 model that has a nightlight built in and comes with a power cord ir functionality is the same in bothjohnconstantelo any idea what’s different or better yes that’s a newer model than the one i already had pros smaller 10 cheaper cons you’ll have to buy a power cable so it may end up costing about the same no nightlight some people will be just fine with that some might even prefer it we do use it as a night light at our house from the manufacturer hub mini requires a 5v 1a usb adapter or an equivalent power source the performance is the same as the hub plus not compromised because of its compact sizeswitchbot hub mini is now microusb powered because the rainbow light is eliminated it is smaller square and white which makes it blend more into the environmentyeah after i got the one set up for the new guestroom tv my roommate liked it so much he got the switchbot mini for the tv in his room same issue it’s a smart tv but there was no way to turn it on with alexagranzy connecting my switchbot with smartthing i can see the devices switchbot created in smartthings but i can only turn them on and off with the ir blaster has anyone gotten any further control through smartthings like volume or input with switchbot ir you can get more controls through alexa which gives you two choices create a scene in the switchbot app you can then activate that scene either through ifttt or through an alexa routine not a smartthings routine set up two alexa devices and have one speak commands to the other this may allow you to access some commands that are not available in the scenes it sounds goofy but it does work switchbot help center commands for controlling ir appliances with alexa after connecting your switchbot account to alexa you could use voice control the ir appliances that you had already added to switchbot hub plusmini before using voice control how to add my ir so just depends on what you’re trying to do in my case as i explained in the first post in this thread all i needed was onoff with voice control so i haven’t really explored the other options availableimage2048×1536 392 kbi’m sorry i rely on text to speech and i can’t

       " 'i am looking for the best sensor that works with smartthings that can reliably detect motion and light level in a bathroom with a window humidity and temperature are bonuses but not required i just installed an aeotec multipurpose sensor 6 and the experience is quite disappointing it has been fluctuating between motion 99 of the time and no motion 1 of the time once it goes to no motion it goes back to motion state within about 2 seconds the other sensors report 795°f 57 humidity 10 lux 0 uv index 100 battery tamper clear with no change whatsoever bear in mind that those values were reported even when i took it outside and left it directly in the sun for 5 minutes brought it back in closed the blinds moved it between rooms turned on the shower etc i have a boxed samsung smartthings motion sensor 2018 i know it would work well because i have had another one for 11 months that is just the right sensitivity and never fails to report until the battery dies however the samsung smartthings motion sensor 2018 is a onetrick wonder and does no light level detection my tolerance for playing with sensors like this is low they do not have to be all that accurate for scientific measurements but a consumer should just be able to buy a sensor and have it work moreorless out of the box without needing to resort to lengthy troubleshooting for a 65 product the aeotec multipurpose sensor 6 is currently being powered by two rechargeable cr123a batteries that are fully charged i read that the sensor is much more reliable with a dedicated micro usb power source but i am simply not willing to go there when the product and its competition are supposed to work on batteries in the first place should i get a separate light level detector or a different product that can do both reliablyi replaced the rechargeable batteries with the factorysupplied nonrechargeable one the motion sensor seems to work as expected as well as tamper detection however light detection is unchanged it went from 10 lux to 11 lux even in direct sunlight and uv index remains 0 something is definitely wrong here even if i were to plug it in to microusb that is not realistic as this sensor is supposed to be installed in close enough proximity to a shower that it would not feel safe there is also tile that should not be disturbedi gave it about 30 hours the lux readings are creeping up slowly but not anywhere near reality i am seeing 3040 lux currently 43 lux in a brightly lit room however 3040 lux cannot be accurate as bright rooms should be a few hundred lux outside is anywhere from a few thousand lux to 100000 lux if aimed directly at the sun at midday but the light readings did not go over 40 lux outside the uv index remained at 0 as well the suggestion to change the reporting rate seems to have helped i set it to report every 8 minutes however although it helped the reasons are still way off i am pretty much through with this product and just want to try something else should i try the fibraro motion sensor next any other suggestionsokay any others i was reading about the xiaomi aqara devices specifically aqara motion sensor xiaomi mijia smart light sensor although the latter mijia smart light sensor apparently isn’t natively supported with smartthings it looks like folks have developed a pretty robust dth as of now the former appears only to report lux values when motion is detected i would be interested in lux values all the time if possiblealright fibaro motion sensor it is plus twopack of xiaomi mijia smart light sensors in 46 weeks i will post about experiences after more products roll into follow up on the fibaro motion sensor what is the runtime of a nonrechargeable cr123a battery in this device assuming default parameters and a normal room let’s say a family room can it take a rechargeable battery what is the runtime of a rechargeable cr123a battery in this device same default parameters and normal room typei have had the fibaro motion sensor running for the last few hours temperature and lux readings are fine i put the sensor behind a book in a dark hallway and the readings dropped to 1 lux in a windowed bathroom the lux readings are consistent with expectations 65 to 373 lux however the motion sensor is not performing anything like what one would expect there are delays of up to 6 minutes for motion to be registered sometimes it will register motion immediately other times it takes forever or does not trigger at all i even picked up the sensor and shook it around about 15 minutes ago the tamper alert went off but the motion sensor did not crazy motion detection sensitivity parameter 1 is set to high sensitivity motion detection operating mode parameter 8 is set to always active color me unimpressed2 motion detection blind time 8 s 3 not shown so it must be the default 4 not shown so it must be the default i am using the smartthings classic app with the v2 hub as far as picking it up when i picked it up i approached it from the front while also in the bathroom i was in there definitely within view of the sensor doing various things for several minutes for what it’s worth the led blinked various colors i recall mostly green occasionally including when i first entered which indicated that the sensor was picking up something however while the sensor continued to report lux changes and even tamper detections it did not report motion events it is unlikely that there was a communication problem between the sensor and the hubi see do you have a good understanding of how the samsung smartthings motion sensor latest version 2018 works is it similar i am thinking i should put up that one right next to the fibaro motion sensor to compare results',\n",

url to documentation https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-simple-device-viewer/42481?u=krlaframboise changelog 252 07112017 added threshold and notification settings for power meter devices added by codethug reduced timeouts by changing main screen to display capability page links regardless of whether or not there are devices with that capability added timeout checking to ensure user is always able to open the application added ranges for thresholds which will hopefull cause the negative sign to be displayed on ios fixed issue with not being able to set the thresholds to 0 this file has been truncated show original i appreciate the support and feedback i have received here with a special thanks to those that have donated at https://www.paypal.me/krlaframboise it is not required or expected but it does motivate me to continue creating new smartappsdths and enhancing the ones i’ve already createdi just released a new version with these new features switches can be toggled onoff from the switches screen added turn off all switches as the first link on the switches screen and tapping it will turn off all the switches on that screen you should be able to use this feature after a power outage to turn off all the smart bulbs that are on but smartthings shows as off see top post for latest versionquotembhforum post4 topic42481 eagerly awaiting push notifications quotethat will be in the next version which i’m hoping to release by monday this is what i’m planning but let me know if you were expecting it to work differently general notifications preferences push yesno enter phone number for sms minimum time in minutes between notifications example if you have 3 devices with a low battery setting this value to something other than 0 will spread the notifications out instead of sending all 3 notifications at the same time only send notifications while in these modes battery notifications notify when battery drops below send repeat notification for device every how many hours empty or 0 for no repeat notifications last event notifications notify when last event was more than enter number last event unit of time minuteshoursdays send repeat notification for device every how many hours empty or 0 for no repeat notifications send notification when device last event is no longer below threshold temperature notifications notify when temperature goes above notify when temperature goes below send repeat notification for device every how many hours empty or 0 for no repeat notifications scheduling optional select momentary button that gets pressed at regular intervals if you have a device handler in place that supports the momentary button capability and it automatically pushes the button at a regular interval the application will use that as a scheduler instead of smartthing’s i added this field for my personal benefit because i got sick of my schedules stopping all the time and this is my workaround which is based on this post by bravenel i created a device handler that uses an arduino uno with the thingshield to reliable push a momentary button every minute subscribing to this dh’s momentary button event allows me to run things on a reliable schedule and one of my other smartapps that uses this method of scheduling hasn’t stopped or skipped a run in over 1 month mbhforum don’t have github integration mine originally didn’t work but dperschonok was able to figure out the problem and after restructuring my repository it now works the way it’s supposed totolik how did you get github intergration to work i think you have to use owner krlaframboise name smartthings and branch master once you’ve set that up in the settings when you click update from repo you should be able to choose the smartapp from the newonly in github box see this post and a couple of the posts after it for additional informationbamarayne are you taking feature request i like getting feature requests because it means that people are actually using the app that being said i also want to keep this smartapp simple to setup and use it’s better to use a smartapp like rule machine to handle the things requiring logic bamarayne on each screen is it possible to add a background color to the status i like this idea but i’m not sure if it’s possible which is why i used to highlight the different state it looks like some of the documentation has recently been updated so after i’ve added the notification feature i will take another look and see if there’s something i missed quotembhforum post10 topic42481 my only recommendation is to allow different push notifications for different last event times quotei like the idea and i also have devices like that so if i can figure out a simple way to implement it i will but i wouldn’t count on it the next version will have a name field so you should be able to install it more than once and be able to tell the instances apart if i don’t end up adding this feature you could have one instance setup to view the devices and 2 other instances to handle the different notifications i know that’s not a great solution but it should provide you the functionality you’re looking forkevinprefer i have cree connected bulbs no category for them they are not switches just lights can you add that functionality in light isn’t a capability but i also have cree bulbs and i just tested that with the cree bulb device type the lights can be selected using either the actuators or switches inputs i just changed mine to the cree bulb device type to confirm this but i usually use the smartpower dimming outlet with my cree bulbs because i found the cree bulb device type buggy and it doesn’t run locallybamarayne such as closed contact sensors are green and open are red i don’t think i will be able to do background colors but i’ve figured out how to display different icons the next version will allow you to set thresholds for notifications but the thresholds will also be used for the icons for example on the temperature measurements screen each row will have a thermometer icon and it will either be blue green or red depending on the specified low and high thresholds on the batteries screen a low battery icon will be displayed for the items with a battery level less than the specified threshold on the last events screen a warning icon will be displayed for the items that haven’t had an event within the specified last event time threshold the icons take up a lot of space because st adds a lot of space to the right of them so i’m going to add a setting that allows you to turn them off if the icons don’t cause any problems in the next version i will add icons for the contact presence and motion sensors in the following version since the items listed on the switches screen are links that toggle the switches i don’t believe i will be able to display icons for them i’m also pretty sure i won’t be able to add icons to the all devices screen eitheri just released version 13 which has some new features but not the notifications that i know some people are waiting for i hope to release another version late tomorrow that will be able to monitor the devices and send notifications these are the new features in version 13 the temperature measurement batteries and last events screens can be sorted by value instead of device name those screens also display icons based on the threshold settings but if you don’t like that feature you can disable it from the other settings section other settings section change app instance name enabledisable new icon feature enabledisable sort by last event time enabledisable sort by temperature enabledisable sort by battery setup thresholds battery temperature lowhigh last event the new thresholds section is currently used to determine the icons but it will also be the notification trigger in the next version see the first post in this topic for the latest version',\n",

have were probably answered in the forum and instructions please take some time to go through the forum and the wiki if you have issues and don’t be offended if i give you the specific area of the manual that answers your question i have spent almost as much time on the documentation as i have on the app if you find a bug or a consistent crash please help me track it down by giving me repeatable steps to reproduce it a nonreproducible bug many times indicates other areas that may be at fault besides the dth if you watch the live logging and see a red error with a line number that

http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=ge_z-wave_motion_sensor_dimmer_switchthis is probably not a bug but more of a perception issue the settings page will never change on its own st security actually prevents this the main screen is what the settings are currently in your case it appears the mode was changed programmatically or was ‘left over’ from the update to ‘reset’ this simply tap ‘save’ and your setting should then match the dashboard and if something like other automation overwrites this you should see this on the dashboard not in the settings areathe items there are ‘one way’ie saving there overwrites what you see on the main page but you can not change what is displayed in the settings programmatically in other words this page are true settings not active representations of the condition of the switch st does not allow dynamic updating of the settings pages on dths hope that explains itokexcellenti did update the dths today and again once you upgrade you should save your settings as i changed some variables from enum a selection from a list to boolean ie truefalse saving will update your settings and then should work greatit is my understanding you need a custom dth to use the device it is not part of smartthings nativelyyes you will need an app like webcore to change the functionality in the evening it is his mine is set up and i love itsure imagepng1178×1529 325 kb in english this is what it does basically during the day the rooms are in occupancy mode and the bathroom is in vacant mode i set the default of the rooms to 99 and turn the bathroom into a switch at night the rooms go to vacant so you have to manually turn them on and all of the rooms defaults to 5 and the bathroom back to dimmer mode the bathroom in occupancy mode will come on automatically using the motion sensor and then turn off after 5 minutes based on the base configuration of the switch in the dth let me know if this all makes senseusing the code on my example just fills in the devices which are unique to my environment as generics you first have to add the devices in your smartthings to webcore then they can be used in your pistons i would do this create a new piston create an if condition choose a way to determine day from night in your environment light sensor mode etc if the then for day area you set the switch to occupancy in the else night area you set the switch to vacant webcore is a rather complicated app but in its simpliest form it is a simple if then else set of conditions if you can say it with word i want to turn lights on in the day off at night then you should be able to translate that to a piston i hope that is helpfulall i upgraded the dimmer to 103 this simple update changes the setlevel option to a ‘boolean’ onoff instead of a pull down if you upgrade you will need to toggle then save the settings for this to take affect the switch version remains at 102 enjoy',\n",

yes if you have the probe it should show on the tile as wellit seems like the latest app update is causing problems regarding how some elements are being displayed i have uploaded a new version of the handler that should fix the issueso i2 i3 are inputs where virtual device sync focuses more on the outputs relays do you mind sharing which binary inputs you are using there would be a couple ways i could handle it in the device handler i could use a button capability that could send button events when i2 i3 are opened and closed so i2 open could send button1 i2 closed button2 etc the other way would be to add a contact andor motion capability to the handler these could represent whether i2 i3 are openclosed i will figure something out but smartthings doesn’t really have a native way to handle something like thisi will update the handler with the ability to take advantage of i2 i3 and will post an update when done although i’m not sure it will fit your use case the way i hope to accomplish it is to have the device have 2 additional contact tiles the user can program functionality based on their open closed statusi have added support for the i2 and i3 inputs a couple things to note you need to install an additional device type it is the contact sensor child device handler and i will post it in the 1st post also after the handler is installed and you have updated the qubino handlers to the latest version go into the preferences of the device and hit done this will create the contact sensor for i2 i3 you can then use those inputs in any smartapp that supports the contact sensor capability imagejpg443×895 754 kb the inputs will show up in separate devices when you go to select them in automations notice the qubino flush dimmer i2 i3 in the below picture imagepng503×895 721 kbi have honestly never tried to publish my work through smartthings have heard bad things about the experience but maybe that is a thing of the past i will give it a shot and see how it goes i will let this version of the handler settle in for a bit before submittal to make sure there aren’t any bugswhich features are you looking to add that aren’t already supported with this handler i have found that the dimmer is kind of finicky with inclusion and usually have to try several timesso the only thing mentioned there that my handler doesn’t support is the direct associations but i do

nonconfusing way right now if you search google for sonoff smartthings you will find my blog post with the old instructions if you want to update from the old easyesp firmware to this new one just go to http://ipaddressofswitch/update and upload the bin image posted below you don’t need to connect via ftdi if you already have the easyesp image flashed also any subsequent update from me will be updated the same way after switching over to the new firmware you will have to reconnect to wifi but this will be a one time process this is a wifi relay that can be found for as low as 5 i have had a

way i also have a version with ground where i just routed the ground wire through the switch enclosureit is a little thicker and longer than the aeon i have several aeon’s but they are all installed or else i would do a side by side with the length of the sonoff it might be tricky to fit into a 1 gang box there are several unused solder pads toward the bottom of the pcb that are used for the rf transmitter on a different model of the switch if any of them are gpio points then an external switch could easily be attached and the rules logic adjusted accordingly michaelahess overall this is a very cool device and a lot of fun to play with let me know how it goesthey took a couple of weeks to arrive source is available on github i am not the author of the firmware but have merely compiled a version of it that supports the rule engine necessary for the switch logic joelw135 i have flashed esp from linux which i am guessing would be similar but the process is very complicated the ftdi adapter i referenced in my original post does support linux and shows up as a devttyusb serial device if you are serious about it you can find instructions here i had to install the esp compiler then the development environment then flash the image if possible it would be a lot easier to use a windows vm and just pass through the ftdi adapter to iti haven’t had any problems with them but make sure you don’t try to go over the 10a rating on them if used as intended i think that they will be fine knock on wood if anyone has any problems be sure to report back here',\n",

tested it i took it to her house it actually shows up in her app but it doesn’t work when creating automations i have removed and replaced it several times is there a way to check and see if it has dropped off the lux never changes after connecting no matter what i do the battery showed 97 but i replaced it to be sure it seems once it’s detected on her v2 hub it just does off i never even see anything in the live logs when i move in front of it and the device luxbattery never updates sometimes the battery goes to 0 until i remove and reconnect it any help is appreciated as this worked beforei just bought an ikea smart plug today i found out it is a repeater that is the only one and paired it next to it in her bedroom where she needed it and it seems to be working i am wondering if the lack of statuses is normal or random for it’s communication schedule i am wanting to browse the handler now to see if i can increase the refresh rate of the sensor even if sacrificing battery life it’s strange that when i ask for help it starts workingis it possible to reset hardware to less than 60s also if the hardware is in the 60s range and 3s before reset i walk around in the dark does it reset to 60s this would make an infinite loop if motion in the room never truly ceasesi repaired it at her place i think i finally got it to work last night it just seems like it is very finicky the humiditytemp sensor paired up right away and worked immediately i do have a question regarding the device handler though there are two 120s resets the first one the sensor only sends a motion detected message so the reset to no motion is performed in code seems to indicate that it forces a nomotion state after a set time since there is no true stopmotion signal what is the difference between this and the second reset interval of 120s that states it checks while in motion active statethank you both this helps me understand how these sensors work as i am not there to test things often i wish i had ordered more to keep at my house now i am curious about another way it may or may not function i have it set so 5 minutes after the sensor turns on the light it turns it off if no motion is detected if motion is detected after 60s i would wager the motion resets and would continue to keep the light on as needed right also this is linked to a google home if someone turns the lights on by voice command but the sensor is in the doorway away from the active area of the room but a motion event is detected i would assume it would attempt to turn them on since they are already on no big deal but then it would enact the 5 minute countdown to turn off correct this would be an obstacle i would need to get past in order to make sure that the lights don’t turn off time to time when they were manually turned on i suppose it would be better for the sensor to be in the active area of the room but then i still need to test it with a ceiling fan running and movement in the dark such as watching tv or tossing and turning during sleep are motion sensors a bad idea for a bedroom or is there an automation setup i am missingthank you this has all been amazing information this all makes much better sense now and will now researching more complex options i like the concept of a virtual switchsensor as far as what i have been trying to do i am considering ordering door sensors to simplify things so i don’t have to make things too complicated over there as the motion seems like overkill for this particular task and the vibration sensors i already had don’t seem to pick up door acceleration consistently this has definitely been a rabbit hole with a much deeper bottom than i expected time to order myself a full round of sensor and build a playgroundthank you for these details i changed the dh code to 300s because at first glance i thought that was how i changed the timeout for the lights i realized shortly after that the app has a spot for that and will change it to 65s as i like your reasoning on that i still haven’t had much time to play with all of the sensor settings in the app but hope to start more this weekend now that this semester is over i am glad to know the tradfri plugs are reliable repeaters as i had read several forum posts stating that the xiaomi sensors could have issues with zigbee repeaters in some cases for 999 those plugs are a bargain i was disappointed to see ikea putting many of their ‘smart’ items on clearance this past weekend and hope it means they are either just clearing slow sellers or making room for newer products my next project will be tackling sms or other notifications again i really appreciate the helpwhat is the night mode option i was thinking about setting the lights to be dim and need to swap out some smart plugs for smart bulbs to make that happenafter a week of leaving this motion sensor up the one issue i have had was this light is set to turn back off after 5 minutes in the app after activation if someone is working in the room the sensor can’t see them because they are not in the entrance pocket where the sensor is if they enter the room and start working on schoolwork work etc the light turns off after 5 mins the google home is used to turn the light on then a if the sensor detects movement it registers the event the light is already on and then the light turns off when it is still needed on b google was used to turn on the light within the 5 minute window of entering the room so it still turns off after 5 minutes obviously a is a placement issue i think a door sensor would work better for this person’s needs anywaybut scenario b is the one i am wondering about are there any settings or whatnot that can make a status originating from a gh hold effect',\n",

sync pending parameter 1 and 2 is not updated to the new values performed by the autocalibration ah good call i propose to fix this by checking if p13 is 0 i think you meant p13 not p14 above if it is then it’ll nullify any target values of p1 and p2 and also p13 after it’s sent this will allow the device to sync it’ll log a warning if the user has set values for p1 and p2 at the same time as forcing autocalibration i don’t think there are any other readwrite parameters that are changed during calibration can you confirm that it is just p1 p2 and presumably p13 that prevent syncing for the record this is a great example of where it would be useful to be able to update the actual input values of preferences on the settings page unfortunately due to ‘security restrictions’ this is not something that is currently possible on the smartthings platform cscheiene is it possible to fix the bug when setting the config from an android phone something like this fibaro 2 dimmer 212 not 211

iphonerhoadesbrown i would like to mention that it does take a while before the dimmer responds correctly i set it to turn off and it would dim down to 1 and stay on after a while this seems to subside sounds like you might need to be using the fibaro bypass module or perhaps you have set relatively large values for the dimming step time parameters 6 and 8 so it takes a really long time to transition between levelsrhoadesbrown as for the bypass module i am extremely that in my house in the uk the ring main for the lights is in the switch back box rather than up in the ceiling it means that i can set it up using 3 wire mode by 3wire mode i assume you mean you have the dimmer wired to the neutral as well as live note this eliminates one reason to use the bypass module but some people may find they still need a bypass module if they have a small number of bulbs on the circuit as even in 3wire mode the dimmer leaks a small amount of current to the load meaning some bulbs flicker when the dimmer is off eg i have all my dimmers connected to live and neutral in the ceiling but i still need to use bypass modules on circuits with only a handful of ledsstevebratt zcapr17 now that this works well with android too have you thought about submitting it to smartthings as official it certainly looks ready i have thought about it but i am going to wait until the androidiphone differences are ironed out and also for some of the missing capabilities to be standardised ie it currently has nonstandard capabilities for fault and scene controller plus another which i am thinking of adding is child protection',\n",

feedback i have received here with a special thanks to those that have donated at https://www.paypal.me/krlaframboise it is not required or expected but it does motivate me to continue creating new dths and enhancing the dths i’ve already createdprjct92eh2 i setup an auto turnoff timer for relay 1 in the config settings the relay turned off as expected but the device state did not update any way to build that into the dth if the device doesn’t send a report when it auto turns off then there’s nothing i can do but it might be sending a report that i’m ignoring and if that’s the case then i can fix it i’ve already disconnected that device from my testing box so can you uncomment the trace line at the very bottom of the code make it auto turn off and then post the logging resultsprjct92eh2 looks like it’s sending back that relay 1 is off it’s just the main switch state that isn’t getting turned off it looks like relay 2 and relay 3 are still on so that’s the expected behavior once all 3 relays are off the main switch should change to off but i haven’t tested that with the auto onoff featureprjct92eh2 i don’t have relay 2 or 3 setup at all do they turn onoff when using the main switch even though i haven’t set them up or created child switches right now i don’t have any child switches created the parent device uses endpoint 0 which controls all 3 together if you enable the create child device setting for the relay you’re using it will create a child switch device that you can use to control and see the state of just that relayprjct92eh2 ok got the child device created now a new problem but this may be out of your control the child device doesn’t update the tile when it’s turned on but the tile for the main device does update it also throws an error when used in the automation creator and doesn’t show up in scenes the switch state for the child device does appear to get updated in the ide i didn’t actually test this handler in the new mobile app but considering that i used a smartthings builtin handler for the child device i expected it would work you also confirmed that the ide is updating so i don’t believe it’s anything in my handler are you using my handler for the double plug if so try changing the type of the child device to the double plug’s child handler and let me know if that works the new mobile app doesn’t like when you manually change the type field so you might have to save it a couple of times andor close and reopen the new mobile app to refresh the cacheprjct92eh2 i hay still trying changing it to child switch to see if it still works it’s already using the builtin child switch handler so i’m not sure how you’re going to do that prjct92eh2 imo all devs need to start testing all their dth in the new app it looks like classic isn’t going to be around much longer except for this one all the handlers i’ve released in the last year were tested in the new mobile app but i wasn’t aware of the release date until after it was released so i had to rush this one that being said the device having issues isn’t the one i wrote it’s the builtin child switch handler so it wouldn’t surprise me if philly33flyers enables the child device and tests it in the new mobile app that the onoff state of the child app would update as expected it might take a little while after enabling the child device for it to work in the new mobile app because i’ve run into a lot of caching issues with it prjct92eh2 but of course smartthings hasn’t provided any kind of documentation for making a hub connected dth work in the new app so it’s not a matter of not having documentation the problem is that it’s not possible for anyone except st to create custom uis for the new mobile app the core code for every builtin hub connected device is on github i’ve gone through the full submission and approval process in the new developer workspace for a different manufacturer’s hub connected device and the handlers are created the exact same way as custom handlers the only difference is tying the branding and product details to the handler when submitting themprjct92eh2 i’m using the default smartthings one i hay still trying changing it to

doorbell button isn’t working try pressing the up and down volume buttons on the device at the same time pressing the physical doorbell button executes the on command but due to the way the hardware functions the sound will play before the events are raised in st when the device turns on it automatically plays track 1 some users have reported the doorbell randomly ringing without the button being pushed but using a couple of seconds of silence as the first track appears to eliminate that problem example of empty sound file silencemp3 the doorbell button doesn’t work if you’re holding it but it works most of the time if you have it on a hard surface the track numbers get assigned to the files based on the order that the files are copied onto the drive more information different dh but it still applies if the ends of your sound files are getting cut off add about 05 second of silence to the end of them i’ve been using audacity http://audacityteam.org to add the silence there’s an option for silence in the generate menu that allows you to specify the amount of time you want to add before you add the silence you should click the end of the track because that’s where you want the silence added afterwards you can use the export option in the file menu to save your changes if i remember correctly it made me install some other component in order to export mp3s but it provided instructions the device stops playing after about 25 seconds whether it’s one long track or a short track repeating because of this the siren and switch will revert back to off as soon as the track finishes available commands on switch capability turns on device which makes it play the doorbelltrack sets attributes status doorbell switch on off switch and alarm capabilities stops anything that’s

additional code needed to differentiate between the button being pushed and a track being played makes it even slower if you’re only using the device for one thing notifications or doorbell you can enable this setting to bypass that extra check and play the tracks faster when this setting is enabled the performance should be the same for secure and non secure devices perform extra doorbell check enabling this setting should eliminate or at least reduce the false doorbell notifications that sometimes occur while playing notifications unfortunately it also hurts performance so you should only enable it if you’ve been experiencing problems the link below will always have the most recent version of this dh so there’s no need to look through the posts to find the last one posted github.com

post3 topic39166 however when i switch the device type from your other dh i got this error quotei’ve found and fixed the problem in version 12 please try the updated code in the top post and let me know if that worksbinhton i now have the notification from pressing the hard button also i’m not sure what you’re referring to i’ve also found it difficult to choose the exact track so i plan on making the sliders smaller in the next version and adding left and right arrows for each one that will allow you to easy jump to near the track you want and use the arrows to fine tune the selection does the delay seem worse or better with this dhquotebinhton post8 topic39166 for track selection i think your suggestion of using arrow for backforth is easier to use quotei’ve made this change in version 13 please let me know if you find it easier to use or if you’d rather see these options in the settings like they are with the aeon labs multifunction doorbell dh the link to version 13 can be found in the first post of this topicquotedperschonok post12 topic39166 this guide also shows you how to update apps and devices once they are in your ide quotethanks again for helping me get my repository configured correctly and for providing the information on how to link it i’ve wanted to be able to update rule machine this way for a while but i didn’t know howdperschonok that should do the trick when i made that comment i meant that with what you posted the first time i was able to setup rm which is something i had wanted to do for a while thanks anyways for the additional informationquoteluvien post17 topic39166 i can select the doorbell as a speech device but when i do this i don’t hear any sound using tts quote the device handler in the first post of this topic doesn’t support the speech or music player capabilities i wanted to get a dh for this doorbell published but since i’m unable to fully implement those capabilities with this device st would have most likely automatically rejected my submission which is why i have 2 versions my other device handler the aeon labs multifunction doorbell supports the speech capability but it can’t be used as a true speech device the aeon labs doorbell allows you to store up to 100 20 second mp3 files and all the speech capability allows you to do is specify a track number to play if the message is anything other than a number between 1100 the speech command will be ignored there are some free online websites that allow you to generate speech based mp3 files so that’s what a lot of people are doing with these device handlers in order to use the custom commands in the dh listed in the first post of this topic you need to use an app that supports custom commands like rule machine if you want to be able to play track numbers using the speech or music player capabilities you need to use the other device handler i mentionedquoteluvien post19 topic39166 do you have a suggestion for the best website that can do mp3 in english and french i don’t care if i have to pay i just want something easy quotei’ve tried a lot of them and my favorite is ivona it’s fairly simple to extract the mp3s from the example page but it’s technically a paid site so i can’t go into detail due to smartthings tos remember to add some silence to the end of the tracks or they’ll end up getting cutoffphilpanfili then recently people come to my door push bell and nothing happens then if i go to speak to press button on it bell will ring when pressed i haven’t heard of that happening to anyone else but here are some ideas the button can be finicky so if you didn’t test it yourself before pressing the button on the speaker it’s possible that it didn’t work because of the way they pushed it that’s not an excuse a doorbell button should just work no matter how it’s pressed but it’s a common problem with this device if it happens again you should try the button yourself and if it doesn’t work then try the doorbell button in the mobile app if the physical button doesn’t work but the one int he mobile app does you’ll know that the device is fine it’s the button that stops responding if it’s been happening a lot lately it’s possible the battery is getting low i wrote two of the device handlers for this doorbell but i’m not sure if they report a low battery properly because i haven’t had any batteries get low enough to test it you could also try performing a factor reset on the device to do this you need to unpair the device and then hold the button on the speaker for at least 20 seconds i’ve done this multiple times and it’s never deleted my custom sound files but it’s probably still a good idea to back them up first please don’t post the same question to multiple topics',\n",
       " 'this is a device handler for the zooz 4in1 sensor zse40 features the main tile can be set to display motion temperature relative humidity light or light lux the secondary status can be set to display nothing motion temperature relative humidity light light lux or all of them there’s a tile that shows the last time the device woke up and received setting changes you can force the device to wake up by using a paperclip to push the hidden button on the bottom of the device but it doesn’t always work so this tile allows you to verify that your changes were actually applied supports offset values for temperature relative humidity light and light lux the device handler reports illuminance as by default but you can enable the report illuminance as lux setting to make it use a calculated lux value there’s a setting that allows you to specify the lux value to report when the sensor reaches 100 because there’s no way to determine the actual lux level you can adjust the frequency of reporting for temperature relative humidity and light you can adjust the motion sensitivity and retrigger time you can change the behavior of the led to conserve battery you can adjust how often the device wakes up to receive setting changes when it’s set to 0 it will report every 10 minutes which is useful when testing the device but i don’t recommend keeping it at that level because it will drain the battery important information motion is reported near realtime but the other values are only reported about every 3 minutes that means if you turn off a light and the room becomes completely dark it could take up to 3 minutes for the light level to change to 0 firmware v3 was released in december 2017 and it changes the range of the motion time setting from 1255 minutes to 1560 seconds after changing the settings you need to use a paperclip to push the hidden button on the bottom of the device after pushing that button wait about 30 seconds and check the settings updated tile if the time didn’t update it didn’t wake up so you’ll need to do it again the light sensor maxes out at around 50 lux so there’s no way to determine the actual light level when it’s above that if you’d prefer it to report 100 lux when it reaches 100 you can specify that in the settings the lux value is a calculation which i’m still tweaking so if you notice that it always seems low or high use the lux offset to adjust it to make the battery last a lot longer use high change triggers for the values you’re not interested in if you’re using it for measurements but not for motion set the motion sensitivity to the least sensitive setting and the motion retrigger time to the highest value screenshots screenshot20180325121558png1440×2880 268 kb screenshot20170328225308png1440×2560

appreciate the support and feedback i have received here with a special thanks to those that have donated at https://www.paypal.me/krlaframboise it is not required or expected but it does motivate me to continue creating new smartappsdths and enhancing the ones i’ve already createdskinny1434 hey this work great i am wondering if i can change the decimal for the rh i have that as my main tile and i would like it to just be a number with no decimals so rather than 5565 just 56 can this be done thanks i should be able to work that in the next time i make changes to itrobertk i have the smart lighting rule set to equal or less than 5 but that didn’t seem to trigger the event to turn my light on could you assist with a brief translation of the handler and how it might related to the smart lighting rules enable the report illuminance as lux setting and then use a value of 1015 in the rule after making that change in the settings you might have to wait for it to report a lux change for it to take effectsyschen i use the notify me when smartapps when motion is detected i get a push notification that simply state active no device name was displayed i just released a new version that should fix this robertk could you assist with a brief translation of the handler and how it might related to the smart lighting rules i just discovered that core ignores events that are hidden from the recently tab so it’s possible that smart lighting does the same thing so this version might fix that problem too skinny1434 i am wondering if i can change the decimal for the rh i have that as my main tile and i would like it to just be a number with no decimals the new version has a setting for round the primary status to whole number which should provide the functionality you’re looking for after enabling that setting the value currently displayed might not be rounded but the next time the value changes it will be enabling this setting won’t round the attribute values it just changes the

mi connector let you know what you have even if you add device manually you type only address and token in the formdefualt port is 30000 your docker or host is using port 30000 already you can change port in configjson which is located shared foldertry to enable developer mode if you add gateway sensors belong to gateway will be showed i haven’t tested gateway v2 but miio library tells it’s possible if gateway is not showing it means xiaomi connector can’t get token automatically enable developer mode github fooxyhomeassistantaqara homeassistantaqara homeassistant custom componentmenu

the leases run for a longer timeare the access points that the wireless clients connect to not ddwrt compatiblei’ve looked at the bluetooth option using a raspberry pi it works well but the range is not great at all it detects me as awayhome when i am moving around my house i don’t think a ping would work either as my phones do not reply to any pings for longish when asleep i have no idea how it keeps wireless as showing active buy if i continuously ping my phone my phone connects it will respond every couple of minute or so when asleep but only 1 ping if using that it wouldn’t be a reliable

you want something more like a classic doorbell button where it only goes on at the moment that you activate it and then returns to the off state on its own both are useful but they serve different purposes device id also when choosing a device id for the virtual switch you need to be careful not to choose one that a future z wave switch will want to also use or that future device may not pair correctly to your network the easiest thing is just to choose a virtual device id that starts with a letter higher than h i start all of my virtual devices with the v virtual switches id conflicting while pair a zwave device devices integrations i have a handful of virtual switches and i set their network device id by taking my last zwave devices id and incrementing it by 1 just recently i was trying to pair a few new ge outdoor outlets zwave and they would never pair i finally realized that they were trying to use the same id as one of my virtual switches i changed all the virtual switches id’s to start with 100 then the new devices paired right away so apparently the new devices were not able to see the virtual switches and know the id was already taken just figured i would post this in case it helps someone else out scott virtual dimmer also for those who want a virtual dimmer see the following how to create a virtual dimmer community created device types hi can anyone tell me

terminology changed as well what used to be listed as virtual switches are now called simulated in the id everything else is the same though one additional issues since this faq was originally written

help other think of uses they wouldn’t have figured out without this communitybamarayne ok newbie question to clarify the use of a virtual switch please tell me if i have this right let’s say i have a device connected to my st hub that is not compatible or recognized by amazon echo i can use the virtual switch to control the unseen device via echo also how do i tire the virtual switch to the physical device basically any results that you can get by toggling a virtual switch on or off in the smartthing mobile app you can then also get by having echo turn that virtual switch on or off see the following deprecated 2015 voice assistant run routine faqsee 2017 faq instead faq on october 1 2016 amazon added the ability to turn on a routine from alexa if you want to use that method see the official support article note that the official method will not allow you to use echo to run any routine that includes a lock or a smart home monitor armed state change or another device class that alexa does not know the method described below in this faq will but it does require that you create a virtual switch although at present echo can only request that smartthings turn devices on off or dim by using a virtual switch you can tell echo to turn that switch on or off and then have all kinds of things happen in smartthings for example if you want to have echo turn on party mode you would create a virtual switch in smartthings authorize echo to use itdid you follow the link i just gave you i know the forum is a little bit confusing you have to click twice on the little tiny arrow that is pointing right on the far right side of the quote and it will take you to that thread step two in that thread discusses exactly that issue and gives you the link to a smart app alexa helper to do just that normally you would connect the two by having a routine that triggers what you want to have happen after your virtual switch comes on so let’s say you want your virtual switch to lock your door you set up a routine that does nothing except lock that door then you use have the virtual switch trigger that routine so here are the exact steps one create a virtual switch two create a routine to do whatever you want to have happen when you flip that virtual switch three use the virtual switch to trigger the routine we used to have to use alexa helper or another smartapp to tie the virtual switch and the routine together but starting sometime early in 2018 they made this an official option so you can have a routine start when a switch comes on so you no longer need alexa helperyeah the links used to be a lot easier to use before the last forum change i’m not sure why they’re so difficult now it drives my screenreader crazydo you mean one where if it’s on turn it off and if it’s off turn it on several people have done that code i think if you search the forum for toggle you would probably find it i don’t believe there’s a standard device type that does that but i could be wrong see the following topic you should be able to amend it to do what you want if you don’t know how ask in that topic and i’m sure those guys will be glad to help you one button on switch to run two different hello home actions smartapp ideas so i have a smartenit 3 button switch which i love i would really like to assign a button to execute two things if in x modes execute y hello home action if in y mode execute x hello home action basically this would be a movie mode home mode button press once to place in movie mode press again when the movie is done to exit movie mode and enter regular home mode again anyone have any suggestions obycode this is why i would really love to see individual button support for this switch controller and the minimote your ios app could so easily handle this with just two entrieswithout even breaking a sweat i would have the whole thing setup in less than a minute and a halfand no coding smile',\n",

heat thresholds that you can set for a given zone composed of 1 or many rooms example in heat mode when above or equal to 78f the vents will be closed below 78f the vents will be open at 100 for all rooms within a zone you can change the temp threshold at different times of the day using schedules it can work with or without a thermostat

using any connected tempmotioncontact sensors for better comfort inside your home it uses the thermostat’s heat and cool setpoints as baseline for adjusting the vents for example if you have 3 rooms master bedroom kitchen family room in your zone the smartapp can do the following the mb’s vents may be open at 20 the kitchen’s vents may be open at 60 and the third at 100 based on room’s temp differential with the target setpoints at the thermostat 77f and the thermostat mode heat cool auto you can change the thermostat’s setpoints at different times of the day using schedules

http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=ecobeesetzonewithschedule the smartapp is similar to scheduletstatzones but it uses the programclimate defined at ecobee scheduled setpoints as a baseline for the ventssetpoints adjustments the smartapp has been designed specifically for the ecobee users who do not want to rely on the st scheduling as it is not as reliable as the ecobee scheduling the smartapp can also resume your ecobee program to avoid creating temporary holds at the thermostat when not needed here is a summary of the changes added a configdisplaypage which shows the running schedule with all zones and room parameters that can impact the thermostat andor smart vent settings you can also use the page to set level overrides for your each of your smart vents in the zoned rooms added 3 levels of vent settings 1 the smartapps can calculate the best level based on each room’s temperature and motion detection in ecobeesetzonewithschedule scheduletstatzones the right level is calculated based on the room’s temp offset differential vs the desired setpoint at your thermostat divided by the average temp offset for all rooms in your zones that way the colderhotter rooms will get more heatingcooling in scheduleroomtempcontrol the smartapp simply checks the current temperature vsa specific coolingheating threshold and just closes the vents when the threshold is met 2 the vent settings can be overridden for all vents in the scheduled zonesrooms during a schedule run ex mornings set all my vents at 100 3 each vent’s level can be overridden at the room level ex set my bedroom’s vent level at 60 and my living room’s level at 25 even if all my other smart vents are set at 100 at the schedule level override setlevel bypass at schedule level for a specific schedule you can now bypass all vents’ overrides set ex at night bypass all overrides and set all my zoned rooms’ vents at 40 nb all my existing contributors who’ve contributed to the above

smart vents from keen home to complete your home zoned solution regardshi yesterday i added a new feature to my heatingcooling solutions based on any connected st thermostats temp motion sensors and smart vents econet ecovent keen home vents the solutions are designed to orchestrate all the above components in order to reach the ultimate comfort at your home their use cases have been described at

http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=ecobeesetzonewithschedule the new feature allows you to avoid false positive in motion detection by inputting the number of motion occurrences needed before the smartapps consider the room to be occupied by default it’s set at 1 motion occurrence but you may increase it if you want to avoid calling the hvac for a one off motion in some specific rooms the configuration can be done room by room for more flexibility the new versions of my smartapps are available for download at my store www.ecomatiqhomes.com/#!store/tc3yr ps for those who already purchased my solutions the new versions will be sent to you today and for those who have also purchased my support packages the upgrade has been done already so you do not need to worry about it regardshi please send me an email to servicesmaisonsecomatiqcom with your version number also did you try to just execute the smartapp normally under the st app the smartapp is not meant to be

based on an evaporative cooler or a big fan switch connected to st must be within a calculated range of temperature humidity values the smartapp is now able to determine the ideal conditions for alternative cooling based on a temperaturehumidity table and automatically switches to alternative cooling only when it’s efficient in order to enable alternative cooling the alternative cooling switch has to be set in general setup and the alternative cooling flag needs to be set for a given schedule you can download the new version at my store energyefficient solutionssolutions

heatingcooling solutions for smartthings and i think that my answer can be instructive for all st users who are interested in more control over their smart vents and their thermostat smart vents are expensive so you may want to have the best apps for controlling the vents and the thermostat in my book the thermostat needs to be controlled in conjunction with the vents otherwise it’s not optimal so which apps it really depends on your requirements if you just need to open at 100 or close the vents based on a room temp threshold then scheduleroomtempcontrol is just what you need the smartapp is designed to run with any st connected thermostat if you have an ecobee thermostat any model not only the ecobee3 and want more options especially with many smart vents and want to direct the airflow towards the right rooms then i’d recommend ecobeesetzonewithschedule smartapp for the following reasons 1 the smartapp is designed to run with my ecobee device which is the most comprehensive ecobee device for smartthings it basically exposes all ecobee features for ha and there are many smartapp available at my github for other ha scenarios github yracinedevicetypemyecobee devicetypemyecobee smartthingsecobee integration 2 the smartapp relies on the ecobee scheduling for setting its programsclimates as the ecobee’s scheduling is usually more reliable than st so even if your st hub is not active for a while there will be some basic thermostat scheduling done by ecobee to control your thermostat 3 the smartapp will not create successive temporary ‘holds’ at the thermostat it is able to ‘resume’ your thermostat’s program when needed ex when you’re back home 4 the smartapp is able to set your thermostat to ‘away’ or ‘home’ based on all your motion sensors at home 5 contrary to the ecobee3’s follow me feature you can configure the ‘occupied threshold’ for every room to be different depending on your needs the ecobee3’s follow me feature is really slow to set your thermostat to ‘away’ it can take up to 2 hours after your departure to set your thermostat to the away program the smartapp can do it after 5 minutes if you want to set it up this way 6 the smartapp has many other options for controlling your fan settings and making adjustments to your setpoints based on all indoor temp sensors just like the follow me feature on the ecobee3 but with all st connected tempmotion sensors not only the proprietary ecobee remote sensors it can even adjust your thermostat based on an outdoor temp sensor if needed 7 for controlling the vents the smartapp is able to adjust them not only when the thermostat is heatingcooling but also every 5 minutes if needed to adjust the vents to the right level in automatically based on the temp differential in each room compared to the average temp differential so based on your thermostat’s setpoints the colderhotter rooms will always get more airflow finally i just want to warn you about the ecobee3’s remote motion sensors do not use them for controlling the vents as they are not meant to be used for real time ha scenarios see this known issue at the st community wiki http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=ecobee3remotesensorinit#known_issues however you can use the ecobee3’s remote temp sensors as they are reliable and can be refreshed every 5 minutes btw all my smartapp are described at the st community wiki if you need more details http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=ecobeesetzonewithschedule http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=scheduleroomtempcontrol to recap for the best control of your ecobee3 and your smart vents you’d need the following my ecobee device with remote sensor app for the temp sensors ecobeesetzonewithschedule if you do not own an ecobee thermostat and you own a nest or honeywell thermostat or even a zwave or zigbee one you can use scheduletstatzones if you want more control over your thermostat and your vents see this thread for more details release introducing scheduletstatzones the ultimate flexible smartapp for your thermostats and multi zoned

issue with default settings not populating after first save 111 06012019 fixed setting ranges for firmware 14 misc code cleanup 11 06012019 this file has been truncated show original i appreciate the support and feedback i have received here with a special thanks to those that have donated at https://www.paypal.me/krlaframboise it is not required or expected but it does motivate me to continue creating new dths and enhancing the dths i’ve already createdshoal007 when i attempt to use the siren 6 using your handler it says 7 pending updates when i click sync it says syncing but does nothing any idea what the problem is sync resends all the configuration parameters but save just sends the ones that are out of sync so can you save the settings and then post the live logging resultsshoal007 device firmware 14 i wrote the siren 6 handler against firmware 12 and i just checked zwave alliance and firmware 14 has completely different configuration parameters the configuration parameters are used to turn onoff the siren and play the sounds as chimes so i have no idea if the device with firmware 14 is going to work at all with my handler the configuration parameters are really complex and they’re not in the manual that comes with the device so i most likely won’t be able to fix this handler until i get updated engineering specsshoal007 thanks for trying it looks like i have a siren that i cannot use currently the stock handler just plays some chimes when the alarm triggers i will have to contact the mfg i took a closer look at the new configuration parameters and it looks like they completely changed the parameters related to the doorbell buttons custom light effects and the tamper volume setting which explains those 7 parameters that aren’t syncing but i don’t believe they changed anything related to playing the sounds in theory everything else should be working including changing the siren settings and chime settings what happened when you tried playing a chime with my handler my contact at aeotec responded and he wasn’t aware of the firmware changes either he’s going to get me the updated engineering specs asap so if i receive them tomorrow and i receive the new siren tomorrow or saturday then i should be able to have the handler fixed by the end of the weekendshoal007 wow i’m impressed when i do the chime and or siren nothing happens i guess that’s better than the siren turning on and you not being able to turn it off but i’m not sure why you’d be impressed by that they didn’t change the parameter numbers of the parameters that control playing the sounds but if they’re not working then aeotec must have changed their behavior and i have no way of knowing what they changed without the updated documentationshoal007 when i do the chime and or siren nothing happens i’ve received the new engineering specs and they removed play control sound and volume from those configuration parameters in the latest firmware which is why my handler is unable to play any sounds it appears that the only way to play different sounds at different volumes is with the sound switch command class which is not supported by smartthings so i’m going to have to manually build the raw hex commands that get sent to the device they also sent me the latest firmware so i hope to have a new version of the aeotec siren 6 posted tomorrow and the aeotec doorbell 6 handler posted on sundayaeotec siren 6 v11 i just released a new version of this dth that should be fully functional with the 14 firmwarerichland007 how can i hear the sounds it can make so i can select the one i like use the slider next to play sound richland007 other more important question is how do i make it sound a certain tone if one of my sensors goes off you can use speaker companion or shm select the device as a music device choose the custom message option and enter the sound number you want it to playrichland007 the slider always says 0 and is just a volume when i touch it it says siren on top no options there to select the different sounds and than an enlarged slider that slides from 0 to 100 when you x out of it it goes back to 0 that’s the slider that you need to use to play the sounds when you close the slider it’s not supposed to do anything because it allows you to play all the sounds while it’s open move it to 1 and it plays sound 1 move it to 2 and it plays sound 2 etc there are 30 sounds so you can use 1 30 to play them allossotsromo edit upon further googling it seems no dth can be run locally and now i see why reddit prefers the pi systems that are fully local no custom dth can run local but some of the builtin handlers can with the lighting smartapp and smart home monitor if i remember correctly when you configure the sirenstrobe settings it stores them in the device configuration which allows you to open the device in the ide and change the type to one of the builtin zwave alarm or switch handlers which do run locally that being said if you’re looking for a hub where everything executes locally you should look into hubitat that hub’s builtin handler for this device has the same functionality as mine and everything on that platform executes on the hubossotsromo unfortunately it doesn’t seem to take carry those settings over i get the default sound no matter what along with the default volume i’m able to get a different sound via setting the dimming value but since it only gives increments of 10 that’s no good either i just checked some handlers and they won’t work as expected but i think there is still a way to turn the siren on locally and use the settings you specify but that’s all you’d be able to use the device for i haven’t tested this but in theory if you use my handlers to configure the alarm tone strobe effect repeat repeat intercept and repeat delay and then execute the both command it will store those values after they’re stored you can change the type to the zwave switch handler and the on command will use the same settings that the both command did',\n",

option in the 1x version maybe it was another app but now that 2x is out this is something in my plans for iti’m seeing an odd issue with the time based events right now they worked well last night after i added the additional 2 time slots however i’m seeing them repeat today or throw errors that the phrase was empty when it was not i’ve added some additional debug logging in my install and am only seeing the child app make the call to speak one time at the desired time but the parent app is processing the talk function twice for no apparent reason i’ve scoured over the code all evening so far and cannot find any reason for the time based event to repeat i’m going to give it a day or two to see if it’s some backend smartthings platform issue before i try to come up with a workaround

       " 'hi all ive been developing an alarm integration for other people never tested by me as i dont even own an elk however it is now at a stage where it should work well for most people to integrate with st it currently pulls zoneoutput names from the alarm send zoneoutput status activeinactive or onoff to st send alarm status to st armed homeaway creates child devices for each sensoroutput so that you can use them in other rulesautomations controls the outputs so you can also automate these through st it is not impossible to add new features but i dont think i will have much time for it now so releasing it as is you can interface with the alarm through ethernet with an xep module in which case a nodemcu can connect to the elk panel through your wifi network direct serial connection to the elk this works in the same way but needs a serial converter and a wemos in order to assist in voltage conversion however requires a free rs232 port on your elk panel you can avoid purchasing an xep module this way full instructions on setup can be found on my github page linked below and if you have any questions then let me know on this thread please i might be able to help though as i said i dont even own the alarm myself so probably only help with code stuff sadly as this project has evolved it has taken a huge amount more of my time than expected so i am only able to sell devices for this automation if you want all the features such as outputs rather than by diying i sell preprogrammed units for a small profit given the many tens on hours spent developing this integration i feel this is a very fair price on my online shop i am able to ship worldwide though for elk it is probably mainly the usa also happy to provide some assistance in getting setup after a few peoples requests i have included a link to donate and they would be hugely welcome to my beer fund here github cjcharles0smartthings contribute to cjcharles0smartthings development by creating an account on githubi have now updated the instructions on my github page to help give a few more details about how to connect to the elk panel when you have a serial connection rather than using the ethernet connection through an xep modulei have just sent you a firmware update link which should hopefully help get everything working quicklyhi bryanharper much appreciated we are very close now its just the last steps missing as they arent tested fully yet currently the wemosnodemcu links to the alarm pulls zone names and status plus can control outputs its just ensuring that everything generates correctly on the smartthings side which it should do but again not fully tested the ethernet integration is most reliable but have tested the serial integration on my computer only not with an actual alarmstrangely i’ve been responding to smartthings forums on my email but they haven’t been posting to the forum will try and copy in my responses below currently as there seems to be no way of getting sensor information out of the elk panel ie it doesn’t know if a sensor is motion or contract there is currently no way for this integration to know i have tried to code it so that a sensor is either always either active or inactive and that means motionopenactive and stillclosedinactive that should allow you to achieve everything you need in webcore or other integrations does that make sense and work for you otherwise i can have another think about possible solutions jschmidty yes i will send you a link to the serial version i need to send the people who’ve purchased a device a copy of the latest firmware and will do that as soon as i’ve had it confirmed that i don’t need to tweak anything else in the code to save people updating multiple timescan you try connecting the nodemcu to your computer usb and then open a serial port monitor to confirm that the node is picking up the messages from the elk correctly after that we can check if smartthings live logging shows any events when zones are triggered or if it is just when the alarm changes statehi all im almost back home now so can start looking at this again and finally get everybody up and running if people are having a problem please can you drop me a message so i can work on getting the last couple of features live thanksjust dropped you an email think most people who have bought one now have it fully working and i’ve got some potential for further changesimprovements in the near future subject to my time limitations will let you know the best and quickest way of getting you set up',\n",

event eg when someone arrives trigger weathertraffic reports jokes fun facts sing songs stories get calendar events create alarms or reminders based on any smartthings or hubitat event many other alexa features there are tons of possibilities there are 50 custom commands available alexa guard control introducing echo speaks actions this new action app will allow you to create rules based on device location schedule trigger events while defining conditions to utilize the full features of the echo speaks devices without requiring a 3rd party app like webcore or rule machine the idea behind actions was to create a simple but powerful app to trigger speechannouncements or other echo speaks features the beauty is in the flexibility of each action it can be as simple as a single speech event when the front door is unlocked to as complex as selecting multiple triggers contacts motion presence etc and defining criteria and custom responses for each individual event type in v32 there is a new tiered response action type that lets you define how many tiers to use and define a delay and response for each multiplerandom ssml supported i use it personally for my kid’s bedtime routine at a certain time it fires the first tier which reminds them bed is in 30 minutes and they should start picking up then 15 minutes later it sends another reminder and then 10 minutes later the final reminder this app is accessible through the echo speaks app and not the market place or userdefined apps the purpose of the app is to eliminate the need for 3rd party rule engines and have better integration with advanced commands introducing echo speaks zones this new zone app will allow you to create a zone using one or more of your echo speaks devices it also you to send action commands to the devices near you based on device location schedule conditions this will allow you to target speech announcements and other commands at the devices that matter and avoid the ones that don’t each

quicker actions was designed to provide an easy to configure interface for the many es features it only takes a few minutes to set up a quick speech item for various triggers under a single action it allows for creating custom responses that are randomly selected per trigger type at the end of the day there is too much flexibility with webcore it’s not very approachable for nontech people and it’s a nightmare for me to support it grclark another question how come some of my routines show up as unlabeled how can i get them to all be named i thought i added in an explanation to the app but must have missed it here’s the short answer amazon doesn’t label the routines in the api so the only ones i can identify are those routines that have voice triggers if i can discover a different way to label them i gladly wouldwell the app only adds the version info for the children when they are installed some how check under the ide my locations smartapps scroll down to echo speaks and see if any actions are listedit’s annoying that amazon bulks all there smart home data in this one locationonce the app is installed it will reflect the version once the initialize function is called by either pressing donesave all the way out or other events like the main app detecting it was updated if you share your diag page with me maybe i can see a potential issue on my part',\n",

       " 'i have integrated the neostat range of devices into smartthings and i am now pleased that it is working reliably with most needed functions on the neo stat air hw plug products this integration also works with rebranded heatmiser thermostats such as the myson touch hub touch 2 hub it is based on using a nodemcu esp8266 chip as a bridge for the neohub hence st talks to the nodemcu and that talks to neohub and that talks to the individual neostats long winded i know but nicely the neohub can be offline if needed and potentially in the future st can also be offline since it uses lan commands there are two device handlers for the nodemcu bridge parent in order to handle communications with the neohub and neostats this device handler can also create children thermostats and send commands to all thermostats as a group for the individual neostats children to act as a st thermostat for each imagejpg400×678 555 kb imagepng400×679 369 kb usage to use the thermostats you can see status info as you would expect you can press the buttons to change setpoint however this is not saved until you press ‘set temp’ if you do this then it will set the temp until the end of the current schedule alternatively if you press ‘30m’ then you can choose to override the schedule for a custom period of time like a boost for a couple of hours you can cancel this hold by pressing cancel surprisingly this will appear only after an override has been set finally if you press away it will put the thermostat into away mode until changed back kind of like standby but a bit safer since it prevents frost the thermostats should automatically detect plugs and timeclocks and as a result display onoff rather than temperature 1 1 if this goes wrong please just go into the settings for the device cog at the top right on the phone and press save this should force it to refresh for setup you can see my instructions on the github page and they are hopefully comprehensive enough any questions please put them on this thread the nodemcu works entirely wirelessly it just needs access to wifi and power through a microusb connection getting the hardware i am happy to sell a preprogrammed nodemcus including 1st class postage within the uk and standard international post virtually at cost price this will be easy to setup by following the instructions in my github page all you need is a micro usb cable for power from a pc port old phone chargeretc i have tons of feedback if you are worried but feel free to ask any questions on this thread online shop known actions or bugs when you create the children thermostats it can give errors sometimes due to an st bug i have had to add a test device button to the bridge dh in order to help though by default it is hidden as not effecting many people any more if you find that creating child devices does not work due to a cannot get property ‘datecreated’ error you see this in the web dashboard live logging page then try pressing this button once then confirm that you have a test device in your st device list then you can press remove devices and it should disappear from device list then you can press create devices and it should work this time the prestat and poststat fields in the configuration settings seem a bit dodgy thanks to smartthings again so sometimes it is not possible to update the names or the updates have no effect ie the device handler still sees cached information i suggest picking a prestat name of thermostat and no poststat name then leaving it like this forever thermostat is a good word to use as it is an easy word for echogoogle home to pick up github cjcharles0smartthings contribute to cjcharles0smartthings development by creating an account on githubsadly because of one single ‘feature’ that heatmiser have implemented carelessly the limit is based on the number of thermostats connected to the hub this is because the only way to get information from a thermostat about its status tempsettingssetpoint is by requesting all information for every single thermostat and this creates a json that is too large for st to handle reliably i have some plans to break up this json so st complains less but thought i would do that after a few more people have it once it is setup whether working reliably or not the upgrade process with any new firmware is a 3 click process realistically speaking it has been tested with 8 stats and it works well but with 11 stats and it is unreliable im not sure where the actual limit is but was playing it safe im far from done on development and will definitely find a way through it but currently dont know how it will work due to a small testing audienceshhh dont jinx the summer anyway drop me a pm and can sort out a nodemcu for you ive only written this addition as st refused to let me post with less than 10 charactersi need to add a few functions to the thermostat and then it should support echo integration in theory but i have not tested it yet as it is not well documented anywhere the actual functionality through echo will not be 100 since neostats have a more limited range of features but i would aim to support boost until next schedule change and away functionality at the least ideally for the individual thermostats and also for all thermostats grouped togetherok so im nearly there with all the echo integration expect an update this week ive got it telling me the temperature and can normally set it but sometimes it gets stuck and stops responding ive also improved the firmware and processing so it is getting closer to dealing with 9 thermostats though still got a few bits to do on thisnot convinced the neostat looks a million times better but it does look better than the prtn alexa integration will work regardless and i hope will be sorted by this weekend for dealing with 9 thermostats there are currently a few options use one neohub for each group of 8 neostats and a node mcu for each this will work today but is a bit of a faff and not the smartest of smart home solutions wait for heatmiser to change their api it is literally 30 mins of coding on their end to ensure that their api works as it should do currently a bug prevents you from getting status from a single neostat and instead have to request all at once and this is what breaks the current implementation despite asking through a few channels ive not had a response i will find a way hopefully soon as i think i am getting close of dealing with the extra data with current solution and intelligently passing it on to st if i can get an apparent bug with an arduino library sorted then that will solve my problems luckily ive got the firmware update process smoothed out so it is easy to upgrade the node mcu when i get a solution to point 3 it only takes a few clicks and doesnt need a pc connectionfor an initial update i have updated the thermostat and bridge dth’s so they are more reliable and all functions should work properly again with the newest firmware i have a few bits to finish on alexa integration as although you can request the temperature there is one bug i havent fixed hence this is yet to come some people have found the device is working with extra thermostats now but its still a bit temperamental so will keep investigatingif you use the latest thermostat device type version uploaded this morning it is now fully compatible with alexa you can ask alexa these two main things alexa what is the temperature in x alexa set x to y degrees where x thermostat name and y is a number i actually expect this integration will be better than the one heatmiser will shortly release since with that integration you will need to say alexa ask heatmiser what is the temperature in x or alexa ask heatmiser to set the temperature in x to y also when you do a temperature set it will set the thermostat to this temperature until the next program change hence if the next change is in 5 minutes the temperature will change again 5 minutes later it would be trivial to add extra intelligence to this operation eg if less than 1 hour till the next change then force it to 1 hour or to do something like default to 2 hoursaction tiles integration is also working nicely thanks to the changes for amazon echo integration hence i now have a tablet which has a tile displaying each room temperature and a button next to ithi all after some comms between me and heatmiser they have coded the changes that i need to allow support for up to 32 thermostats on the bridge it is currently going through testing on their end and then they said they would get me to test it before release to the public at the same time i will make a few changes to my code to support it and hopefully a few nice features added in to improve alexagoogle home integrationhi erlendaakre the nodemcu should stop broadcasting its own ap after you give it your wifi details since it does everything through your own wifi if you turn it on and wait a few minutes with no wifi it will automatically start broadcasting an ap again in case the wifi details have changed yes wpa2 support is good i have done some testing of the krack fix which has been released but it is currently only in beta build from the arduino library and hence comes with some extra problems i have spoken to the team about getting a full production build released with krack included meanwhile they can work on finishing their beta into a subsequent release i hope to update on this within a week latest and i will add the beta fix if they don’t release a full production build after some more testingi have just tested the firmware changes that heatmiser are just about to release as a tester and thankfully they allow up to 32 neostats with my integration very pleased it is all working well and they have worked with me to improve their api i will publish my updated code hopefully over the weekend you just need to upgrade the device handlers not nodemcu firmware as i understand it apple are currently blocking heatmiser’s release to the public but i think it will happen fairly soon as for the firmware changes to fix krack i hope to release these next week as i mentioned above though still hoping that the arduino nodemcu library build gets updated to be official rather than me using a beta and it causing other bugs as soon as it is updated i will release the fix will take me 10 mins once they havedavidfensom i guess there must be a rule on new members sending private messages i have sent you one and

smartapp works great to open and close the door but it does not have the ability to natively monitor the myq openclosed status smartthingsmyq has a nice feature that allows the ability to add smart tilt sensors to a myq controlled garage door for monitoring openclosed status smart tilt door sensors can add up in cost depending on how many doors you have and they are not always reliable recently myq added a premium service feature to support various partner integrations with myq unfortunately smartthings was not one included in the smart partnership but ifttt was a selected partner the service is considered a premium service and normally cost monthly or yearly but as of 62819 the service changed from paid to free before the limited time free offer the cost was only 1month or 10year which can be cheaper than buying smart door tilt sensors with the added bonus of accurate openclosed status for now the service can be enjoyed for free unless they make a change to the offer this

do that also if you do not know howcool pun intendedi am not sure but i do have to figure that out i have the problem also my mitsubishi when started by pressing cool on the remote starts with the fan in auto mode and the house cools well when i start from the zxt120 the fan runs low and it doesn’t cool well up until now i haven’t needed it but it is getting hotter now so i need to figure out why this happens i think it will be easy to just send a fan speed with cool the question is how to select the fan speed we want to set i have to think about that a bitspotlizard that’s good to know i thought it was a quirk with mitsubishi codes but if it happens to you also i need to look closer at the device code and see what it is doing honestly i would prefer it keep the previous setting of the fan and only issue the cool command but if sending the fan command works i will live with thatpretty much trial and error i tried several before realizing i was setting them wrong and had to start over then when i started to do it right they all seemed to work this makes me wonder what the difference is but i just picked one and it has been working fine i have 5 mr slims and have been using

       " 'we are thinking about moving to a new home and i have some questions regarding our smart home setup during showings and when we move most of the setup i plan to take with smartthings hub lights buttons sensors etc that are not hard wired into anything i tried installing some smart switches but there are too many wires in the boxes and i could not get any to fit and still work will definitely go with however i do not necessary want to switch out all of my smart bulbs for regular while going through this process but want to make certain that potential buyers can turn on the lights when touring our home because my wife was a bit reluctant about using an app or talking to the google speakers to work the lights i made a point that each room that has smart light bulbs also has at least one light fixture that still works by the switch except the deck actually i just realized all of those are now smart bulbs but i’ve placed covers over other switches to make sure they stay in the on position for smart bulbs what have others here done with your smartthings setup when showing your home to potential buyers is it as simple as explaining to your realtor that’s why some of the switches are covered or do you maybe provide instructions on how to turn them on on a related note but not smartthings specific i also have a couple things hard wired into the house my ecobee thermostat and nest hello doorbellcamera i figure that some people may like those things to remain and they may not even be compatible with the wiring in the home we ultimately move to we are looking at homes that were built in the 20s30s or earlier i’m leaning toward leaving them and then determining what will and will not work in the new home and simply buy new but if i do that are there any potential security issues with leaving the doorbellcamera andor thermostat behind will doing a factory reset and removing those devices from my account be enough to protect both us and the folks that buy our housei was not really considering any legal requirements that something should remain so thanks for pointing that out to me i will talk to our agent about it more yes i did mention the doorbell and thermostat which i figure would be best left as i’m worried wiring in whatever new house we move into won’t be compatible anyway my main concern about those is security issues when leaving them i don’t want them messing up anything with my account and i’m sure they don’t want me being able to be able to mess with them after we are out not mentioned in my original post is the nest yale lock on the front door that i do plan to take so i’m guessing i’d need to replace that with the old deadbolt before showing the house then as far as lighting most of the smart bulbs are in table lamps or floor lamps and not in hard wired fixtures for the ones that are in fixtures the wired switches are all dumb i just have the clear plastic covers over the switches so my wife or kids don’t accidentally turn them off i could remove the covers for showings and when someone flips the switch the smart bulbs will still turn on to their default setting and off again via the switch essentially turning them into dumb bulbs temporarily i have two lightify buttons that fit over the top of the standard dumb light switch which is easy to remove so the dumb switch will work the rest of the buttons are the newer smartthings buttons that are just magnetically stuck to a metal surface or sitting loose on a table i’m actually missing one i suspect the cat knocked behind something all of the lights tied to those buttons are in table lamps or floor lamps not fixed fixtures water leak sensors aren’t even visible except the one by the sump in the basement and i can simply pick that up i do have multiuse sensors on two doors and one on the overhead garage door that would not be as easy to simply remover and replace when showing the houselflorack however i believe that home automation ends up being a series of personal choices i think i would prefer our new home to not have smart stuff already in it for that reason i’d want to set it up myself the one we want yeah we’ve already found one we want and are working our butts off trying to get ours ready to list before it sells has security cameras that are staying part of me likes that part of me is thinking what brand are they what system is it will it work with my stuff can i use the existing wiring to replace them with cameras i want now if we can just get the kids to help purge all of the excess stuff in our house to make it more presentable and i know the switches and outlets all work we have had a mix of white and cream throughout our house when we bought it since we decided to try and do this i’ve been going through the house replacing all of the cream colored ones with new white ones as well as telephone and cable jacksand several months later we are actually doing it assuming nothing goes south at the last minute the latest we move in to the new house is the end of the month in preparing our house for listing i did the following i also talked with our agent about this who had a little bit of input we decided to leave the ecobee thermostat and the nest hello doorbell i removed all smart lights that were in permanent fixtures i removed the covers i had over the switches for those smart lights i removed the two osram buttons that fit over switches i had removed the door sensors and motion sensors replaced the battery operated nest protects with regular battery operated smoke alarms and replaced the smart locks with new regular locks so the only smart things left for showing the house the thermostat and doorbell camera that are staying with the house and some smart bulbs in table deskfloor lamps none of which are connected in any way to a switch was all of that necessary i don’t know but i did want to avoid any confusion as much as possible going without the automation for a few weeks but that’s ok',\n",

       " 'after a power outage zigbee bulbs cree ge etc all turn on i know there has been a lot of discussion about this but i haven’t seen any apps to try and address the situation first is there an easy way to get the current value of batteryinuse from the hub data if so then what about an app that cycles every few minutes if batteryinuse then set a flag not batteryinuse and flag from previous cycle was not batteryinuse then it records the state of selected devices if not batteryinuse and previous cycle was batteryinuse ie the power is back on then set selected devices to their previous state i know that this isn’t perfect and things may change in the physical world between the time the power comes on and the hub goes online but this should be close enough i’m looking more at the short minute or two outage at 3 am and not having to get up to shut off lights i’m guessing the biggest hurdle is that this has to run local any way to create a device that polls the batteryinuse and have an approved locally run smartapp do the turning offthe issue for me is getting up in the morning and finding a bunch of lights on the first floor have been on all night i would guess that if the outage is due to an emergency it won’t be coming back on if it does the lights that i want to shut off would not be in my primary evacuation path anyway the canary bulb idea is interesting but you’d think there should be a way to do this programmatically rather than spending 50 on hardware just for this purpose i do appreciate you input thanksi’m also looking to address the issue when the lights come on during any time of the day we are often away for the weekend and come home to find lights on this would still work if i use a canary bulb that is not used for anything else a 15 investment additionally to avoid shutting lights off on people where they were on before the outage i still would like to save the state of selected bulbs i’ve seen a smartapp that was doing this for some reason i will have to hunt it down so if canary bulb is off then save the state of the selected bulbs if the canary bulb is on return the bulbs to their prior state and turn canary off since both of the functions needed above happen while there is power we don’t need the smartapp to function while the hub is offline i’m guessing the app should cycle and check to see if the canary bulb is on rather than subscribe the bulb’s power on as the bulb will come on before the hub reconnects and i’m guessing the event would be missed also would like this to work if the batteries die during the outage so anyone feel like writing this i am a developer but not in the javascriptgroovy world so it will take me a while to muddle my way through iti’ve looked at that solution apparently version 1 motion sensors are hard to come by also i’m more concerned about the lights coming on when the power is restored more than the notification of the outage i will get the hub offline notification if there is a power outage although i won’t know if it’s power or just internetthanks again to jdroberts for coming up with the idea of the ‘canary’ bulb and the name below is working code which should do the trick groovyjavascript is not my forte so don’t laugh if the code is a bit rough around the edges basically it records a list of the bulbs that are off whenever any of the slave bulbs change state and the canary bulb is off then if the canary bulb comes on it turns off any of the bulbs that were off the last time the states were saved if also polls every 5 minutes to see if the canary bulb is on just in case the on event was missed due to the hub being offline due to the power outage works with my simulated power outages turned some bulbs on some off pulled the network cable from the st hub

       " 'i’m interested in having the smarthub control some lg 65uh6030 televisions a whole array of them these are internet connected via wired ethernet and they are set to respond to wakeonlan commands so always listening i’m reasonably sure these devices can be completely controlled onoffvarious functions via the web api but i don’t know for sure let’s start simple has anyone been able to control webos 30 lg devices yet i’m happy to follow other people’s hacksi confess i’m really looking for a simple restful way to run just a few basic commands i’m not trying to code an interactive app i just want to issue turn on change to web browser app navigate to page http://foo.bar.com and then in other instances turn off duh i have 6 tvs right now and it’s trivial for me to individually record their ethernet mac addresses andor do any individual figuring out of pairing codes which seem to be a thing in lg tvs edit the difference between issuing a random http get or post and executing a python or npm is significant i can trivially cause get or post commands but i cannot trivially execute more complex scripts at least as things stand nowi just ran across https://github.com/dan06/smartthings-lg-smart-tv which is damn close to what i’m looking for has anyone tried it unfortunately this is specifically noted as pre2012 tvs where i have 2016 modelyeah i’m aware of that package and i’m finally broken down enough to play with it today there are two reasons i didn’t do this up front i was hoping there’s a native way to do this with my st platform thus not requiring any other devices on my lan i’m not a node user and i kinda didn’t want to be i don’t want to have to play with a new platform just to do a single thing with all that said i just discovered i can run node on my synology ds15 which is the only other device always on that lan and separately i’ve discovered a handful of useful packages for some other smart connected devices notably my daikin hvac system which is web connected using their adapter net result i’m playing with node now also for the record i’m actually trying to control a set of tvs six so i’m going to have to hack around to pair with man at a time i’m happy to start small though complete control over one device is a great startwell i’ve found some better packages but i’m now a bit lost i’ve determined that https://www.npmjs.com/package/lgtv2 is a newer version of the package you cited unfortunately the original lgtv package is no longer supported and even better there’s https://github.com/danovadia/lgtv-http-server that seems to do exactly what i want unfortunately i have no idea how to install and use https://github.com/danovadia/lgtv-http-server the instructions some cutandpasted from the source project and even those instructions don’t make sense to me i’ve installed and tried to run the example but i literally don’t know how to tell if it’s pairing with my tv or not i will pursue getting the github fork and node packages installed on my synology elsewhere in relevant forums and whatnot but i wanted to cross post the progress here just in case anyone else is interested or wants to help solve the problems here which is fine by mequick update i have a solution now in short i had to give in and use node to augment smart things slightly more detail for now i’m not quite done yet so some of this may change but in general i have a synology device so i used the gui to install node note that i actually have node and apache both running which doesn’t seem to be a problem at all ssh into my synology and using npm i installed lgtv2 so literally npm install lgtv2 obviously plug my lg tv in with wired ethernet slightly less obviously i needed to enable wakeonlan which is done implicitly by disabling the power saving mode this was tricky to find because it seems to be relatively recent that lg changed this workflow and the old docs all refer to an explicit wol menu that’s no longer there put this in a text file i will call it tvcontroljs this is pure javascript meant to be executed by node note that i’m using static dchp so my tv’s ip address on my lan doesn’t change you’ll need to decide how you want to point at your tv basically put the correct lan ip and ignore any readme instructions you find about lgsmarttvlan or anything like that those are in the other lgtv node package v1 that i’m not using var lgtv requirelgtv2 url ‘ws192168123000’ lgtvon‘connect’ function err res lgtvrequest‘ssapsystemlauncherlaunch’ id ‘comwebosappbrowser’ target ‘http://google.com/#q=smartthings+lgtv’ lgtvdisconnect execute the script with node tvcontroljs note the first time you do this the tv should ask you if it is ok to pair with the network remote which you’ll need to manually approve with your existing television hardware remote eg the ir one successful pairing should save a kind of keyfile locally that will be automatically detected by lgtv2 so you don’t need to repair in the future all the magic was in step 4’s javascript it was a bit hard to figure out how to hand the right request payload but now that i’ve got it i’m all good i’ve run some spot checks and this command forcefully opens the web browser to the url in question no matter what else the tv was doing exactly as i wantedin theory yes i power on my tvs using wol packets generated from the synology device although i think st can do wol too maybe i activate the web browser and tune to specific urls using my integration and that’s it i believe you can launch netflix but i have not tried i also believe you can control the input function but again i haven’t triedit is a bit clunky but using a raw http get request over to whatever device is running node should work just fine i just have a cronjob on my other device that executes what i want on a schedule entirely outside my st sphere of influenceto the best of my knowledge there are no practical ways to ask are you on or off right now however you can deterministically infer state by simply pinging the device send an icmp packet devices capable of wol should drop icmp packets when they are off and in my experimentation lg tvs will reply to icmp when they are on starting a few seconds into their boot process and continually while they are awake note that icmp is handled at the network interface level and it does not necessarily mean your tv is happy it could be on but also lockedfrozen i’m sure there are innocuous functions you could run from the lg control libraries that would help validate if the tv is happy like check volume levelbloatedtoad however whenever i attempt to do an npm start i get i have to ask why you are trying to run npm start literally what is your goal i think you might be missing some fundamentals about node the webserverdaemon and the node package manager npm i would explain npm start in plain english as node package manager please install a package called ‘start’ to my computer i’m going to guess that’s not what you’re trying to do i use node to run individual scripts directly i do not have node running all the time on any of my computers as a permanent always on webserver is that making senseso i don’t use node for much either this is the only thing i’ve ever done with it and after reading further right now i think my understanding of npm as i posted a few minutes ago is incorrect i suggest you ignore that perhaps someone else with more experience can help out here',\n",

       " 'a project by stan dotson standotsoninfo and matthew nichols mattnicholsname would you like to have a smarter lawn we just updated our smartthings project to build a smarter irrigation controller the project originally posted to the old smartthings build forum since then we have made some significant progress and it is time to share our progress with the smartthings community the entire project can be downloaded in our latest release some of the highlights for our project are simple toconstruct using an arduino a thingshield and an 8channel relay we have even provided step by step instructions controls up to 8 16 or up to 24 irrigation zones with options to activate a master pump and master relay includes iphone controls to manually start and stop the system an irrigation scheduler app allows for automatic control of the system a rain delay feature skips watering when the your local weather history and forecast indicate rainfall above a threshold no need for moisture sensors an accessory app provides additional flexibility to manage your automated irrigation schedule around yard projects after application of weed control during winter season etc each of the zones can be virtualized with their own switch capability using modified code from badgermanus this allows an irrigation zone to be integrated with another smartthing for example connect a sprinkler zone with a motion detector to chase away deer or other intruders from your yard or let your repair person test your sprinkler using the aeon minimote irrigation controller app we created an irrigation controller app devicetype to manually control our system from an ios device each zone has its own control tile the tiles are used to turn on a zone queue up a zone to run next stop the currently running zone or remove a zone from the queue the main tile turns onoff the entire system at once the main tile also shows when the system is on rain delay below is a pic of the irrigation controller app when a zone is off the tile is white the tile turns blue when the zone is on and is gold when the zone is in the queue you can enter your manual run times using the preferences tile image013png360×640 157 kb irrigation scheduler app the irrigation scheduler app allows the system to run automatically you can set up as many instances of the irrigation scheduler app as needed to cover every irrigation scenario for example set up one instance for to water the lawn and another instance to turn on a drip system this flexible app allows you to select days of the week and an interval to start your system the days of the week option is handy if you are under watering restrictions or if you want to skip watering on the day you mow the lawn the app also allows you to schedule up to three waterings per day multiple starts per day is useful after reseeding you lawn when its important to keep the soil moist the irrigation scheduler is also smart the app uses a user supplied zip code to look up the local weather history and forecast a virtual rain gauge measures the rain from yesterday today and adds in today’s forecasted rainfall the app will push a message and skip watering if the virtual rain gauge exceeds a threshold the threshold is set in the preferences here are a few pics of the irrigation scheduler app irrigation scheduler1jpg640×1136 409 kb irrigation scheduler2jpg640×1136 417 kb summary all of the code for the project and step by step instructions can be found on github matt and i have been using this project to irrigate our yards this summer several others including billwitt27 and ziembajason have also successfully installed the project its cool having a connected sprinkler system that can be controlled by an iphone and the smart rain gauge is conserving water while keeping our lawnsgardens healthylooks like you still need to properly install the libraries use the links to download them once you have the zip files downloaded you can import them within the arduino ide go to the sketchimport libraryadd library drop down menu once you have added the libraries they will show up under sketchadd librarycontributed as timer and smartthingshi i just updated the release and the read me files to include the timer library instructions and links fyi the links were also in the header of the arduino sketch as an additional watch out the timer library downloads as a zip file that needs to be renamed change the name of the file folder that contains the code to timer before uploadingkmugh that is an interesting question my understanding is that there is already a smartapp for a garage door opener that uses a momentary switch to trigger the garage door and a smartthings multi to detect if the door is open or closed our arduino sketch would require changes to allow a relay time of a few seconds which would be needed to simulate a garage door button push the most surgical change would be to change the zone time preferences to seconds vs minutes and remove the 60 from the calculation on line 76 its not very intuitive for setting your sprinkler system i think it would require multiple code changes to allow decimal input for minutes ie 01 min you would then implement the virtual switches from badgermanus then select the virtual switch and multi using the garage door smart app the garage door smart app may also need some changes so that you can see the virtual switches as a choice in the input with the above said i am not sure you gain anything by the time you buy a couple multi’s one for each door you have spent more than if you just build a dedicated garage door opener there are a couple arduino door openers on github including one that i built see https://github.com/d8adrvn/twocargaragedooropener my implementation uses wired sensors to detect if door is open or closed this has two advantages over the using a multi wired contacts are cheap and they do not use batteries which can be an issue in colder climates also i have added a lock capability to make it easy to program your doors to close lock when you go to bed or leave the home another alternative is to pull some of the code from my garage door opener and merge with the sprinkler to 1 implement a brief relay action and 2 add the wired sensors this would be a bigger project',\n",

functions syncronizes the shm alarm state shm mode and any defined keypad light modes when changes are made to the shm alarm state or shm mode when shm alarm state is changed for example from the dashbboard sets the shm mode to follow when the current mode does not match a user defined mode for the alarm state when shm mode is changed for example from webcore or actiontiles set the shm alarm state to follow when the mode is defined in modefix and the defined alarm state does not match the current alarm state when using a keypad the keypad’s arm state lights follow changes to the shm alarm state and mode activation requires two steps in global application settings set the fix mode option ontrue create then save a modefix profile default profile initially shows in the child app have you ever wondered why mode restricted routines smartapps and pistons sometimes fail to execute or execute when they should not i gave up trying to use mode for core pistons now i know why it did not work perhaps like me you conflated alarmstate and mode however they are separate and independent smartthings settings when alarm state is directly changed using the smartthings dashboard home solutions a smartapp or a webcore piston—surprise mode does not change shm routines generally but not always have a defined systemalarm and mode setting experienced smartthings users seem to favor changing the alarmstate using shm routines avoiding use of the dashboard’s home solutions if like me you can’t keep track of all this or use the dashboard for changing the alarmstate or action tiles for changing the mode the mode fix option may be helpful for each alarmstate set the valid mode states and a default mode mode fix attempts to correctly set the mode by monitoring alarmstate and mode for changes

state which keypad are you using iris or xfinity centraliteyes im also editing my posts when you change only the mode and it creates unexpected system states such as alarm state home mode away try setting the system by changing the alarm state not modeokay also please let me know on the iris if the proper kepad lights come on when setting partial and oni checked the source code when using a keypad and mode changed from a source other than the keypad it should set the keypad light to match however it doesn’t currently set the alarm state it appears there’s sufficient information in the mode fix data to set the alarm state from a mode change i will take a look at thiswhen using actiontiles to change only the mode my xfinity keypad icon immediatly reflects the change however the st alarm state remains unchanged changing the alarm state on mode only changes was never a supported option with version 1 of this app nor the lock manager’s keypad module did this work for you prior to switching to version 2 betaok thanks for all the testing are you saying when the mode only is changed the st alarm state changes to follow if yes i will add that logic into verrsion 2 just wondering what is being used to change the mode also when using the beta shm delay and setting the iris keypad with partial or on do the properr keypad lights come on edit just wondering has

of resources on the community forum the search is a powerful tool tags and categories are generally well maintained before getting started if you have zwave and zigbee devices you will need to exclude them from your wink hub before you can pair with your smartthings hub while it’s possible to reset most devices or have the smartthings hub exclude them for you if any of the zwave devices especially locks are using the anti theft command classes you will not be able to use them unless the original controller wink excludes them first so just to be safe exclude them from your wink controller and then pair with your smartthings hub getting started with smartthings what do you need smartthings supports zwave zigbee and many wifi devices bluetooth is on the roadmap to use zwave or zigbee device you will need a smartthings hub some lan devices eg nuki lock foscamamcrest cameras etc also require a hub if you have only connectedwifi cloud 2 cloud devices eg tv’s wifi plugs nest august etc then you just need the smartthings mobile app you can see a full list of supported devices in the new smartthing mobile app smartthings hub for zwave zigbee and some lan devices there are many different versions of the smartthings hub v1 2013 v22015 v32018 wifi adt nvidia sheild etc the most recent hub is the smartthings v3 2018 and smartthings wifi hub rest assured they all work just fine with smartthings however there are few subtle differences between them once you’ve got your hub you will need to create a samsung account and add your smartthings hub to the account smartthings mobile app there are two smartthings mobile apps for the iphoneipad and android phones smartthings aka new v3 app connect oneapp smartthings classic aka legacy v2 app it is recommended to start with the new smartthings app and register your hub using it the classic app is due to be retired later this year while both apps can work together each has has their proscons the new smartthings app is standardized and supports the next generation of devices cloud to cloud wifi bluetooth etc in addition to zwave and zigbee the classic is the older app and is geared more towards custom ui’s for zwavezigbee devices and is an optional download note that some smartapps and devices require the use of the classic app to get access to their customfull functionality keep in the mind that both the st mobile apps are just user interfaces to interact with smartthings see image below everything runs in the smartthings cloud platform or the hub and not on the mobile app which is why both st mobile apps can be installedused at the same time and both will show the same information with some exceptions how smartthings is organized smartthings has four key concepts to note automations a feature of the new st app which allows you to create basic automation triggersrules from within the st app itself eg if motion is detected turn on light scenes a feature of the new st app which allows you to create groups of devices which can be controlled via automations smartapps sa these create use cases and automation functionality they can range from simple basic automations turn onoff devices to complex automations climate control lock users property management security rules the forum has many custom smartapps you can find a list of apps on this wiki and smartapps installation instructions here device handlers dhdth these allow the hub talk to your zigbee zwave and wifi devices while smartthings has a wide range of stock device handlers custom dths bring out the best features of devices a custom user interface and also connects devices which don’t have stock support the forum has many custom device handlers you can find a list of apps on this wiki and device handler installation instructions here smartthings is a cloud platform with some local processing it means that almost everything goes through the smartthings cloud all smartapps and custom device handlers run in the smartthings cloud the smartthings mobile app classic and new send your requests to the cloud the cloud in turn communicates with your hub which communicates with your zigbee zwave and local lan devices a few zwave zigbee device handlers and smartappsautomations run locally on the hub due to limited resources on the hub which provide a faster response time it means that it’s a best practice to keep your hub and internet router on a ups so that it’s always connected to the internet in order for you to have constant access to your devices from your st app untitled1141×1121 611 kb first start by connecting all your devices to smartthings zwave zigbee wifi cloud etc now you can start using automations and smartapps to control these devices create notifications etc useful guides short guide on getting started with smartthings smartthings beginner’s guide 2020 a community setup wiki that is an organized list of various projects smartapps and device handlers https://thingsthataresmart.wiki a set of common faq’s a recommended read if you’re using locks with smartthings list of wink to st tagged topics afterwink integrating alexa with smartthings step by step instructions on how to install custom smartapps and custom device handlers using the new st app some faq’s what’s the best approach to start pairing my devices with smartthings assuming that you’ve already excluded your devices from your wink controller it not start by resetting them and excluding them using your smartthings hub in general it’s a good idea to follow this order for adding devices to your hub for a smoother migration process pair your mains powered zwave plus devices pair your mains powered zigbee devices pair your mains powered zwave devices pair your battery operated zwave plus devices pair your battery powered zwave devices pair your battery powered zigbee devices setup your wifi and cloud to cloud c2c devices if your device has trouble pairing try these steps exclude the device again resetpower cycle the device reboot the hub power cycle bring the device within 5ft of the hub and try pairing how do i connect wifi or cloud devices to smartthings smartthings has a built in library of integrations for many wifi and cloud devices using the new st app click on click on devices now search for your device by name or brand and follow instructions to have the devices show up in your list of devices if you can’t find your device then search the community forum for any custom device handlers or integrations for those devices feel free to share your feedback and comments and i will keep this guide updatedgood point let me modify the recommendation there are still quite a few things that need the use of the classic app the new app is getting there but not nearly there yet plus many users still feel the classic app is more responsive and ofcourse only the classic app provides access to custom device features at this timefor your lock you may want to check out this device handler particularly since your lock has many advanced features and also fixes a few issues with the stock one release universal enhanced zwave lock device handler for programming the lock check out lock user management lum which is a very powerful and flexible app release lock user management lum for your switches you’re better off using the stock device handlers since they don’t have any special features or settings which can be helped through a custom handler the added advantage is that the stock switch device handler runs locally on the hub and is fastermore responsive it can also work with local automations in future incase your internet is outthe first post should provide you with faq links and an overview of the various concepts with links within smartthings if you’re having trouble with a specific integration or custom app it’s best to post in the original topic as it’ll get more response from users of that appintegration',\n",

       " 'hi ive created a new device handler for sony bravia tv’s i’ve obviously been testing with mine which is a 2015 55 inch and all functions work well so far you will need to set up your tv on the network via lan or wifi and turn your tv’s security to psk ive tested with a passphrase of 1111 but you should be able to use whatever passphrase the tv allows enable remote start on your tv settings → network → home network setup → remote start → on enable preshared key on your tv settings → network → home network setup → ip control → authentication → normal and preshared key set preshared key on your tv settings → network → home network setup → ip control → preshared key → sony give your tv a static ip address or make a dhcp reservation for a specific ip address in your router note within the device on the smartthings ide the device network id for device instance must be hex of ip address and port in the form of 000000000000 ie 100122080 is 0a0001dc0050 if you check the logs the smart device will log the correct address that you can copy paste once the ip address has been set if this is not set you wont get updated onoff status apparently you can get the device handler to set it but ive not been able to properly test this yet the interface is basic and ive only added a few buttons from the remote but over time i will try to add more unfortunately there isn’t much in the way of feedback from the tv with the exception of the on or off status so the app works more like a remote than something we can read status from i would be interested in hearing some ideas about uses for the device handler however as in smart apps for tv set up etc my aim was to be able.to setup some sequences perhaps on a virtual button for instance a netflix scene button could in theory wake the tv from standby switch to netflix and lower the lighting or you might be able.to have an xbox scene using one of the hdmi inputs not sure how all that would work perhaps a smart app would have to be put together but maybe i will try that another time gist.github.com https://gist.github.com/steveabratt/43133bf9011febf6437a662eb5998ec8 braviagroovy sony tv smartthings integration

the license at http://www.apache.org/licenses/license-2.0 this file has been truncated show originali forgot to mention if your going to have a go with this can you let me know how you get on setting it up and if it works which model sony tv your using and how old it is im wondering now also if the remote codes will work with cec and if so i may be able to combine more remote codes from other devices such as surround sound amps and blueray players into the remote i have sony versions of both those things so i should be able to test it although mine are quite a bit older than this tv isa further note there is a small bug currently that sometimes shows the tv as on if it’s gone into eco sleep mode as the tv doesn’t respond to any polls for status in eco sleep my intention is to somehow test for this in future and if the tv isn’t responding at all st should send a wol packet and a turn on command from the normal on button instead of having a separate wake on lan button however for this simple release i’ve not had time to look into that yet you may want to turn eco sleep off while using this but i do intend to at least try to support it as best i can in futuregreat news thanks everyone for getting back to me bennetm3 is correct on the psk front i will edit the top post shorty with the full instructions there won’t have chance to work on this tonight but perhaps tomorrow i will bash about with it and get a few more buttons on there are you guys hoping all buttons will be available or are you after some specific functions i was hoping i’d be able to control more of the buttons from smart apps but at the moment i can’t use any except the off and on onehave had a small bash around this afternoon no major changes just trying some things out i think ive solved the eco mode issue now however so if your tv has gone into eco sleep when you press the on button the the tv will send a wake on lan packet instead of a standby on packet however if your tv is in standbye it will send a standby on packet instead which should remove the need for us to have a wake on lan button and hopefully allow you to keep eco mode turned on on your tv’s turn on time is slightly slower but power saving may be much better still not yet to solved the tv thinking its on when its in eco sleep but still bits to do tinfranca unfortunately i couldn’t get the remote codes for power on and standby to work previously with my tv but ill have another go later and report backi’ve updated the code with the latest proddings bennetm3 should be happy as i added the pic off button to test something i also added a digital button which switches to the tigital tv input wake on lan works on the on button but eco mode still shows the tv as online when its off ill try to add the rest of the buttons soon but its a slog to add them all on lol let me know if ive broken anything',\n",

the whole point of the posting the changes above is for 2 reasons users can pick and choose the customizations they want when st updates the base code you can always just readjust the changes posting the whole code will just make it increased work to maintain the code which is what happened with the original thread i’ve tried to make it step by step details walk through of how to make the changes and categorized it so you can choose the ones you wantdon’t want if you feel i can make it simpler let me know and i will update itno unfortunately it can’t run faster that’s the way it works slider works great for large changes updown for smaller changes i think your thermostat may not be responding to all the modes correctly check this piece of code and check what your thermostat returns as

nextstatetocool state tocool label cool actionswitchmode nextstate state label actionoff nextstateoffthe reason it can’t run faster has nothing to do with this code but to do with the underlying device type code the device type does a set followed by a get with a 1 second delay between to let the device the commands this delay is what you’re seeing if you used a custom device code and removed the delay this delay will dissappear it’ll be there irrespective of what type of inputs you use slider or buttonsi think it takes upto 24 hours to populate just refresh and waitno i don’t think it can this code refers to modifying the base code from st and not the whole code in itself so putting on git won’t helpcheck the live logs and also the manualfixed battery updates not working after new year on some thermostatsthat’s correct the device app doesn’t poll the device to the use set temp the app only displays the last configured temperature interesting point will see if it can be done',\n",
       " 'i’ve gotten totally lost and judging from forum comments i’m not the only one i know that some ring models work with the new v3 app and some don’t but i don’t know which is which ring doesn’t help anything because they make it hard to find the actual model numbers and there can also be firmware differences also note that just because a hardwired version works that doesn’t mean a battery operated version will and vice versa i’d like to use this thread for handson verification that specific models do work or don’t work if you do have a model working can you also indicate which features can be used in smartthings automations for example can the motion sensor be used can the siren be controlled from a smart things automation can the mode be changed from a smartthings automation etc also i’d like to limit this thread to what works with the new v3 app given that we’ve already been told that the classic app will be going away eventually and potentially by the end of this year thanks for everyone’s help with this there just have been so many changes over the last six months i want to pull together all the current information in one place there is a separate but different thread for arlo models please keep this one just for ring thanksprjct92eh2 do you happen to know where you can find this specific info i don’t see it in the app anywhere the firmware level shows up when you try to integrate with the model but i don’t know of anywhere else it’s something that has been brought up in multiple forum posts back when people were having issues with particular ring models resolved cant add ring floodlight cam hardwired to smartthings device type floodlightv2 is not supported at this time devices integrations that’s good to know hopefully the right people at smartthings are looking into it because i can’t seem to get past l1 support of course it would have been nice to know this before i did my rma and all my lighting automation broke and would definitely be nice if support smartthings or ring knew about this issue instead of just continuously asking me to clear cache thanks for the input i’m no software engineer but here’s to hoping someone somewhere can add a line of code that says floodlightv2 that will get us up and runningperduewv these are ring cameras i have and the device models per smartthings great write up thanks for all the detailtimjones has confirmed in another thread that ring devices at least some of them now have a model number sticker and that there is a difference with the spotlight cam’s depending on which model you have ring spotlight cam wired to smartthings devices integrations i just bought one on amazon and have the same problem the samsung support page here https://www.smartthings.com/gb/products/ring-spotlight-cam-wired mentions the model is 8sh1p7 but sticker on the back of my camera says 8sh2p7 searching amazon for 8sh2p7 gets me to the page i bought the camera from as jdroberts always says model number matters i guess given that the 8sh1p7 is supported it needs ring to change their integration to include 8sh2p7 though i’m not sure i have the patience to try to get that through to support though i think i might just return it that confirms with some other people have said in the past although their devices did not have stickerstimjones i thought the integrations were supported by the individual vendors that’s true for any new integrations that were added beginning in late 2019 the ring integration was created prior to that and was created by smartthings basically if it was an official integration in the classic app then it was probably created by smartthings this may indeed be part of the problem now – – that smartthings isn’t intending to update the old integration for new models and ring hasn’t committed to taking over the integration yet but i’m totally just guessing on that',\n",

to me from smartthings support sent wednesday april 24 2019 325 pm to subject smartthings re new app cloud control setting gone apr 24 1225 pm mst hello thank you for contacting smartthings support accept my sincere apologies for late response i’m sorry you’re running into this issue in your smartthings app but i will be happy to look into this if you are running into this issue in your smartthings app i recommend uninstalling your smartthings app and reinstalling it to make sure you are on the most recent firmware version for the app once this has been done try adjusting the cloud control option once more if the issue persists you will want to report the problem inapp so the issue is brought straight to the developers to do this tap the menu 3 dots icon from the dashboard page and select the help option from the help menu select report a problem and enter in the issue you are experiencing this will ensure the issue is brought directly to the attention of the developers please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns and i will be happy to help thank you best regards smartthings support www.smartthings.com my response from sent sunday april 28 2019 853 am to smartthings support supportsmartthingscom subject re smartthings re new app cloud control setting gone so this is an issue with a feature you have removed from the app i have verified that i am on the latest version of the new smartthings app currently version 172966 and verified that the feature is missing on both mine and my wife’s phones that have the app as well as our other two backup phones i am just asking if there is a way to access this feature otherwise i am pretty sure i was clear about what the issue is when i wrote the initial email there used to be an option to turn off cloud control in the smartthings app not talking about the classic app now it is no longer there are you stating that the feature is in the latest version of the app indicating it was there before was removed and then was put back i am a bit disappointed that support is recommending a nuclear option of removing and reinstalling an app without first asking to verify what version i had i will add that i have already force closed and reset the app to original by clearing cache and then clearing data then clearing the phones app cache and then performed the painstaking process of setting up all the settings i originally had i am not willing to go through all of that again until such time as i am told that it is confirmed that the menu settings i mentioned originally have been verified to be in the new app currently i cannot see how 4 phones would all have the same unique problem this indicates to me that this is a feature that you guys removed so please verify for me that the instructions referenced in my original mail are available to us members before i uninstall or do anything else with my app for reference those directions are open the smartthings app and select the 3 dot menu button in the top right of the screen 2 select the settings option 3 toggle the cloud control option on or offnot quite what i was trying to do i am looking to turn off all connections to my st hub through the new app i have multiple custom device handlers and find the inclusion of the 100 items i have to be too cluttered i only want to use it for the bluetooth controls to my cars and watch many of my devices do not work in the new app without me rewriting the handlers which if i am going to go through the trouble of doing all of that i will likely change to a competitors platform that is at least all local control st support finally got back to me and told me that was not possible anymore they did at least fix it so that i could turn them all off individually and it finally remembers the settings the setting you are talking about is for updating devices and services not for turning on and off cloud control of the hubplease see what i stated about the response from st support tweason st support finally got back to me and told me that was not possible anymore they did at least fix it so that i could turn them all off individually and it finally remembers the settings not sure where you got that i was using an outdated version of smartthings app new or classic but they told me they specifically got rid of that option so the actual opposite would have been true if i had not updated i would still have the ability to cut off cloud control i find it absolutely ludicrous that one has to go through each individual item and turn off control one by one there should be an option to select all or turn off cloud control altogether or better yet like the google interface they have maybe they should offer the ability to selectively include instead of exclude individual items not using the new app until they send out the notification that they stated was coming over a year ago saying that it was ready for production also not using it even then unless it is backwards compatible and i do not have to rewrite all my apps that i have written and custom device handlers as stated before if i have to rewrite everything from scratch it will be time to move to a new platformfrom the last i heard from support there is no way to turn it off it is on by default once you log in to the new app',\n",

from a function to another function and i thought of having a dedicated topic for this app where i can update my efforts and share it with every one i have been using this app for a good year now my wife loves it i haven’t shared it with the community as its not polished but it always gets the job done i’d be happy to share the code with you and also elaborate on how it works will pm you with the code code is now on github no need of pm explaination on triggers in general triggers are based on the in built modes away i’m back morning night of course you can configure them i have setup st to put home in morning state at 630 am and in night state at 1045 am automatically also away i’m back mode are triggered based on the presence sensor in my case mobile phones of myself and wife even if you don’t use your phone as presence sensor the modes can be triggered from the smartthings widgets you know it at 1045 pm night mode is triggered by st which triggers the armstay mode of totalconnect at 630 am morning mode is triggered by st which triggers the disarm mode of totalconnect when phones are not at home away mode is triggered by st which triggers the armaway mode of total connect you always need your st app on phone running in background for location services to work well or you could use the widgets from the app to set the appropriate away or imback modes for the app i have created a separate profile at total connect console https://rs.alarmnet.com/totalconnect2#/ recommended that all said there are some quirks that i need to iron out before i could actually publish the app for the community totalconnect apis do not make it easy for me to work on this and also im not a programmer by nature of my work i will explain those quirks in the pm hopefully i will get some time to figure out those some day quirks are iron out no need to pm check the update some screenshots how app looks what input it accepts how it logs and how it reflects on the total connect web

well though i will appreciate any one that wants to use it and let me know if it works or not note there are many awesome implementations for totalconnect alarm by folks in this thread which you should consider if you want full control i will try to do justice to them but i may fail by listing what they do list of appsdevicehandlers for totalconnect you only need one of this installed please

status mode based code https://github.com/mhatrey/totalconnect/blob/master/modesbased.groovy author mhatrey i wrote this smartapp for simple automation based modesroutines of smartthings this is a very minimalistic app and i prefer not to dwindle much besides this but there’s lot more you can do using rest of the appsdevice handlers written by folks in this thread functionality of the app smartthings away mode arm away smartthings night mode arm stay smartthings i’m back good morning mode disarm with this latest version i have implemented a way of automatically pulling locationid deviceid so all you need to enter are your user credentials per request from berg03191 i have added a smartapp based on smart home monitor status shm based code https://github.com/mhatrey/totalconnect/blob/master/shmbased.groovy author mhatrey 2 devicehandler that act as panel as well as virtualized lockswitch code https://github.com/oendaril/totalconnectasync/blob/master/tcasync.groovy author oendaril this device handler is written to as a smartthings device ie a virtualized lock light and performs arming actions based on lock onoff switch onoff notably switch on armed stay lock on armed away switchlock off disarm after installing the code as device handler you will need to create smartthings device by clicking new device at the top right and then filling up rest of information be sure to select device type by pointing to the device handler scroll to the bottom you will totalconnect device created before give it a name of your choice and device id anything unique thats not matching your existing devices once the device is created you will have to edit and fill in preferences that contain your login credentials for totalconnect to find locationid deviceid oendaril has written a crafty smartapp that you can run in the simulator to fetch that install the following code as a smartapp and get that https://github.com/oendaril/totalconnectasync/blob/master/tctesterasync.groovy 3 complete totalconnect panel code go to smartapps click settings top right add a repository with the following

appreciated thankssure thing code is now at github i will pm you with instructions on how to go about it basically its about fetching your deviceid locationid im also working on v03 but i have seem to

text below benefits of my ecobee device vs st ecobee stock device or other thermostats my ecobee device is far better than any dumb zwave or zigbee and even a nest or honewell lyric thermostat when connected to st as it does not need to be scheduled by st contrary to other thermostats connected to st my ecobee device and my smartapps can work in conjunction with smartthings and ecobee as the code exposes the ecobee’s own scheduling for ha something the st stock device doesn’t do for any other thermostats st needs to take over their scheduling when connected to the home automation platform and this is sometimes unreliable you don’t want to wake up cold or too hot in the middle of the night because of some st scheduling issues for more details about the benefits of ecobee vs other

include bug fixes the normal thingssilly misspellings logic errors bug reports label if you have a need to change the name of the app you can now do this via settingsadvanced section suggested by bamarayne major optimization shortened the code considerablyif you are able to do so there is also a specific section about my ecobee tips commands available under the st community wiki http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=ask_alexa#my_ecobee_tips ps the main idea is to get relevant tips for your location at a given time based on indooroutdoor metrics and observations if you do not have tips at a specific moment try again later when indooroutdoor conditions have changed regardshi fyi the runtime stats can be sent to grovestream for even more data analytics so that you can plot them against other factors at your home as an example

the outdoor temperature has been constant but yet your daily runtime stats ac furnance 12 staging components have increased compared to the day before’s runtime stats or your weekly runtime stats or your monthly runtime stats if the outdoor temperature has not been constant in the period based on some standard derivation formula of course the stats will not be relevant for generating tips at your

       " 'good evening all today i bought the ikea wireless control outlet kit with twobutton remote searching online how to integrate this with smartthings i only found posts from a few months ago saying that the button counldn’t be integrated but after a bit of playing i have managed to get the button to control up to four actions so i i have joined the forum so i can share what i found in case it benefits others how to use ikea tradfri outlet and twobutton remote with smartthings i bought the kit with the plug socket and twobutton remote which are both zigbee compatible the button comes paired to the outlet but we’ll erase that pairing and route all control via the smartthings hub to pair the outlet with the smartthings hub i went into the smartthings classic app selected ‘add a thing’ then once it began searching and with the outlet plugged into the mains i held the reset button in the tiny hole at the bottom with a paperclip until the flashing lights did their thing and the outlet appeared in the list of devices found smartthings recognises the outlet and has a device handler for it so you complete adding it to your devices as normal smartthings can now control the outlet like any other outlet or switch to pair the ikea button with the smartthings hub i pressed the little button next to the battery quickly 4 times to reset it it flashed red four times to confirm then i took out the battery and left it out for about 20 seconds then in the smartthings classic app i went to add a thing and it started searching i put the battery back in the button and again pressed the little button next to the battery 4 times quickly red lights flashed four times to confirm the reset then throbbed gently and smartthings found the button now it appears as a main device with two child devices main device ikea trådfri onoff switch child device ikea trådfri onoff switch bottom button child device ikea trådfri onoff switch top button i let it keep those names for now while i got to grips with things if you look into the activity logs you can see actions are being logged when you press the buttons now if i go into the device in my list of devices in the new smartthings app it seems to offer me the option to assign actions to the various button presses but if i try to do that the app crashes however if i go into automations and add a smart lighting automation i can add an automation that does whatever i want triggered by the ikea button i have found that it is best not to select the child devices just select the master device as the trigger then you get the option to choose button 1 or 2 button 1 is actually the one marked 0 with a rought texture on the device and button 2 is the one marked i with a smooth texture on the device you can also choose pressed or held and you can choose the action as a toggle if you like as a test i created four automations press button 1 toggles onoff my kitchen light press button 2 toggles onoff my cabinet lights hold button 1 toggles onoff my patio lights hold button 2 toggles onoff the ikea outlet with the smart lighting automations you can do pretty much any combition of actions you would likely want with the switch so even though it looks like the button hasn’t been properly implemented yet it’s good enough if you don’t mind a bit of extra set up work the ikea tradfri outlet is a bargain at £10 and at £19 for the kit the extra £9 for a zigbee button that can do four functions seems like an absolute bargain to me the outlet uk version can handle a full 13a and the european version can handle the a full 16a so what more could you want from an outlet and the button is a great bit of design the two sides of the button have different texture so you can feel in the dark which side you’re pressing it’s very small and light it has a strong magnet in the base to cling to a metal surface and comes with a base plate to screw it to something and a couple of 3m sticky pads i think it’s a great bit of kit for £9 i will definitely be buying more of these kits well done ikeaplaying with it today i found two other routes if the smart lighting automations don’t suit your purposes in the new smartthings app you can add a custom automation this does allow you to select the ikea button choose which of the two buttons on the device to use as the trigger and choose pressed or held as the trigger the advantage of using the custom automation is that you can combine criteria with and or or rules in the if statement for example if you press the top button during the day it could put the main bedroom light on but if you do the same action at night it would put the side lamp on or activate a scene with dim lights maybe if someone presses it while you’re out you could light the whole house up like a football pitch and send a text to your mobile the other useful method i have found is using routines in the smartthings classic app i have set the good night routine to run automatically when the bottom button is held i use the good night routine to turn off pretty much everything in the house so i always use it when i go to bed and being able to run it from an ikea button next to the bed is a lot better than having to go into the app or talk to my google home mini when everyone’s in bedgreat result so for the 5 button remote in the iphone app it looks like it works 100 correctly i wonder if the issue that i and others have found whereby the app crashes when we try to set the actions is down to the android app or the fact that i was using the twobutton remote thanks for sharing the video',\n",

something that sounded like it would be perfect for what you wanted but again uses custom code what does that mean how hard is it to do and what’s the difference between a smartapp and a device type handler note the official terminology has changed a couple of times device type handler device handler dth and device type all mean the same thing and you will find all these terms used in the forums section i smartapps and device handlers what they are smartapps tiny programs to decide what a specific device should do when or to collect the information from a specific device smartapps including the various f gets me most of the way there but is missing critical information follow the part about using using a custom device type handler get down to the point of dt5 once the device handler is published in your own library we then go off on a tangent because it’s at this point things go bad the instructions just aren’t clear enough at least for me now we go into your mobile device and launch the smartthings classic app perform the physical installation of the device per the directions i found the video on home depot’s product website to be far more informative than the included documentation after the breaker is turned back on and before you turn on the power switch this would be a good time to put the fan blades arms back on and tighten them down once installed and the breaker is on go to the room with the device if you are more than say 10’ from the hub make sure you have a working zigbee repeater in the room with it turn on the light switch controlling the circuit tap the my home bottom tab tap the things tab tap add a thing let it search and find don’t go looking through the suggestions mine comes up as a buscop smartpower outlet v1 that’s fine change the device name to what you want in this case i just put front room fan go back to the ide click on my devices from the display name column find the name of the device you just found and click it scroll to the bottom of the page and click edit under the type drop down list scroll down almost to the bottom to find and select kof zigbee fan controller then go to the bottom of the page and click update close out any smarthings app new or classic and relaunch your classic app your fan and light controls now show up in the things tab test all should work well at this point notes 1 in my case i had misread a setting on the remote itself that actually interfered with the function of the controller there is a switch that has an o and a d setting for dimmin on and off i thought i had it in the o position but but lights wouldn’t dim if dimming fails try switching this to the other side 2 during the physical install i found it tricky at best to stuff the wiring in a manner that would allow me to actually get the canopy back on i found that if i stuffed the wires above the controller and back into the box particularly the wire nuts the canopy was able to be reinstalled but boy is it a tight fit and this is an older at least 20 year old hampton bay fan lastly the installed pics i kept the antenna wire for the remote outside of the canopy for better reception however i really don’t like the look i have to figure something out 20190323113506jpg2851×2138 223 mb in order to prevent accidentally turning the power off and to provide storage for the remote but i did was i took a strip of clear packing tape and taped the switch in the open position so that there were as few air bubbles physical as possible i then took velcro and cut it in 2 pieces put a piece on the main part of the remote and the other half on the battery cover and stuck it to the switch plate 20190323203131jpg3024×4032 289 mbi figured since i got hit with a bit of confusion by that thread that i will go ahead and write an endtoend installation write up don’t get me wrong it’s a very good thread as most of them here are it’s just a very long thread when you are trying to get to the meat of the matter without being only go back in and re edit see your 1st entry the stuff in the middle tends to get lostfor those that are unaware these controllers are reported to work best with a zigbee repeater in

both for alarm and for zones integration with mqtt in addition to smartthings integration you can use other esp8266 boards but the wemos is good as you need some voltage regulation chips to power the esp from the alarm panel and this is normally 12v powering from an external usb power supply is a recipe for damaging your panel 8b092f025f861e0b2f2542416f9424c475a26a05450×866 77 kb note that if you have certain powermax boards then you will also need an arduino in order for the wemos to talk to the powermax uk models of powermax and us powermax pro are the models that need an arduino powermax express can have an awkward power supply so you might need to do some soldering but it is very easy and a single connection full instructions are on my github page but suggest discussions happen here since that way everybody can help each other to controlread alarm status through webcore you will need to look at the ‘alarm’ capability of the device st sees this as a belllight and not an alarm panel to set the alarm through webcore you will need to change the alarm capability to ‘siren’ for example which will cause the alarm to arm in away mode alternatively if the alarm changes to ‘off’ then it has been disarmed the following states show the lookup information for alarm status offdisarm sirenarmaway strobearmhome bothalarm ie if alarm status changes to ‘both’ then your alarm has been set off ie an intruder i am also selling preprogrammed wemos chips with all required cables and adapters to plug and play with your powermax if you are setting up this integration it would be lovely if you would consider supporting development by purchasing a device through me though you can follow the steps to your hearts content i am also selling preprogrammed arduino’s which are needed if you have a uk powermax or us powermax pro plus potentially others online shop donations to my beer fund are of course welcome and much appreciated for those who have asked me for a link https://paypal.me/cjcharles github cjcharles0smartthings contribute to cjcharles0smartthings development by creating an account on githubim based in london and i got it off ebay about 3 months ago im pretty sure you could do the same with a nodemcu but i havent done any testing and it doesnt have any voltage regulation circuitry so you would then need to find a decent voltage regulation board if you can find a d1 r2 then that would be easiest i expect and can still be bought for a reasonable price but be very careful to get a good quality one as there are some poor quality ones out there that can either make flashing very difficult or damage the powermaxwhen buying them you just have to be careful as the serial chips can make flashing difficult as you have to faff with multiple different drivers before it starts to talk to your computer also this can make integrating with the alarm harder if you get a bad one might be worth spending a few more mins looking as there may be one closer to home also it is definitely worth getting a good quality board since there are some very poorly built knockoffs on the internet that would either not last long or cause damage through shortscurrent drawhave just pasted in a big update to the arduino sketch and the device handler so that virtually all wemos configuration is now done by smartthings and the inactivity timers are working well and in fact customisable through smartthings this will probably be my last major development for a while as it has been taking up so much of my timedid you have any luck getting set up khmera hope my instructions werent too hard to followthe files need to be inside a pmax folder inside the libraries folder the files should not be in the sketch or libraries folder either probably they will possibly do no harm but may cause duplicate includeskhmera did you get there in the end im hoping you got the include sorted and that you sussed that the code on github should be copied in to replace all code in your sketchsorry i didnt see your edit just your original post it seems smoov is having the same problems as you with the enrolling step not happening hence it only has access to arm not disarm or receive zonenames or receive zoneevents he also is using a powermax pro so it makes me think there is something missing for powermax pro enrolling i would love to have an answer but it is difficult without the hardware to hand for testing so i will do a bit more digging and come back with a few optionstry unplugging and replugging the wemos and see if it will pair after that it can take a few minutes or more sometimes and can require a couple of restarts of the wemos also about half way down the arduino sketch is the initiation delay you can try increasing it and perhaps have more luck if you have a fast board like powermax complete you can pass 0 to init function like this pminit0 this will speed up the boot process keep it as it is if you have issues downloading the settings from the board pminit change this to have an 8 inside the brackets pminit8 also if you do plug wemos back into your computer or use arduino ota update at the top of pmaxh is this line define powerlinkpin 0x3622 try changing it to use a 1234 pin ie change the ending of the line to 0x1234 that might also help force it to pair',\n",

       " 'there’s one giant thread devoted to people doing this i thought i’d share my story as a recent data point especially because i ran into several hiccups but it all worked out in the end a couple months ago i installed two hampton bay ceiling fans but the zigbee controllers were all sold out so i had been operating them as dumb fans i put a watch on the coveted hampton bay universal fan control and it finally came into stock a couple weeks ago installation yesterday i went through the process of installing the control units for the most part it went smoothly despite the fact the directions weren’t as descriptive as they could be basically i undid 2 wire nuts one tying together the fan light and house hot wires and another tying the unified fanlight neutral to the house neutral i left alone the grounding wires as the control unit doesn’t need to be grounded the control unit sits nicely in the space between the downrod mount and the outlet box i tried to get all my wires aligned nicely in this phase i found that a little planning helped a lot in figuring out how the wires and antennas would be routed then i connected the three wires from the fan to one side of the control unit and the two wires from the house to the other side since my fans are also hampton bay the colors matched up nicely on the fan side my house neutral was black but connected to a red wire on the control box here’s what it looks like i could probably have been tidier with my wire slack 20180904235619jpg3024×4032 257 mb controls i agonized a bit over how best to handle the wall light switches i ended up just buying simple switch guards and sticking the remotes next to the switches with command strips it works great i still instinctively reach for the switch but having the guard redirects me for the remote 20180904235042jpg3024×4032 282 mb once i fired up power everything worked well my fan doesn’t allow me to completely hide the chain controls on the fan unfortunately and i don’t want to permanently sever them 20180904235934jpg4032×3024 287 mb smartthings setup it was a bit challenging to navigate these forums to get exactly the right information and i found the developer web portal pretty finicky but i eventually got it working first i paired the control units with my hub it took a while to successfully get the control units to enter pairing mode i think what works is to alternate 3 seconds on and like a half second off 3 seconds on 3 seconds off as the manual states wasn’t doing it i named the devices and they were registered as basically unknown devices then i added the 3 device handlers i personally did this by working through the github integration i went to my device handlers settings and in this panel i added the repo for the custom device handler it then took me to a screen where i could import the device handlers from that repo and i checked the publish box screen shot 20180905 at 121526 ampng1048×148 911 kb prior i had tried cutting and pasting the code but it just disappeared within the same session maybe because i didn’t publish it at the time next i navigated to my devices i had to go through my locations to actually see my devices though for some reason otherwise i see nothing but anyway under my devices i clicked into each of my ceiling fans hit edit then under the type drop down i scrolled allllll the way down to select kof zigbee fan controller at the bottom but not either of the two subdevices and voilá it was done at last so far everything works as expected i’ve got a reliable connection with both my remote and my hub i’m a happy camper update i installed dimmable led bulbs which let me enable that function on the physical remotes and use the dimmer functionality of the smart appyeah i spotted that in one of the threads but i just didn’t think it would be worth it i’m actually just fine with having the remote stuck to the wallthat’s pretty neat but i’m not sure it’s actually a more elegant solution for meso you’re probably in good shape because the fact that you have two separate switches at the wall means that the circuits exist to control the fan and light separately routed through the control unit you should be able to use a voltmeter to figure out which terminal is which at the fan if you don’t already know you’ll have to decide what to do with that wall switch since it won’t play nice with the control unit for a setup like mine with one master switch exposed but covered you could tie the fan and light load wires together and connect to an ordinary single switch not sure all my terminology is onpoint here good luckyeah the online developer interface is certainlysomething i didn’t experience anything like that maybe try excluding and readding it and see if that helps you do have to set the fan itself to high for the control unit to be able to cycle through the full speed range but this shouldn’t impact the basic responsiveness of the control unit if you have better luck with the other two maybe the first one is a dud good luck – this stuff can be really frustrating at timescongratulations on wrestling your setup into submission that seems to be what it take sometime yeah i don’t know why the factory reset is so finicky it took me minutes of switch toggling at different cadences to get it right my wife probably thought i was losing my marblesboth of those things sound concerning i’d read the docs for your specific fan to see if there’s a reset because i would guess this technique is specific to the zigbee control unit if you’ve got two separate wires for your light and fan hot wires there might be hope but it kind of sounds like your unit might be a fully integrated thing worst case you may have to change fans but that might not be that difficult since you already have one installedgreat hopefully you’re in the endgame now i discovered the devices before installing the device handlers there are 3 of them but i doubt it matters',\n",

simpler thanks to the work of mathieuh who reverse engineered the new tls connection i have been able to update my app to continue to work for both pro and non pro bridges it does require a new step

instructions install nodejs currently my app will not work correctly on windows due to an issue with auto generating the required certs using openssl if you are a windows user i hope to have a guide to do it manually very soon and i will post it here on windows just dl and install https://nodejs.org/en/download/ on a raspberry pi if you have an older pi bb etc this guide should work http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/ if you have a newer pi23 etc try this one the nodejs instructions are down towards the bottom http://thisdavej.com/beginners-guide-to-installing-node-js-on-a-raspberry-pi/12 assuming you have node installed correctly simply type npm install lutronpro’ at the command lineterminal this will install the server as well as all it’s dependencies automatically paste the following url into your web browser and press enter you should then login using your lutron credentials you should then see

go to my git repository https://github.com/njschwartz/lutronpro and grab the runnodeserverjs file you can either dl it or just copy the couple of lines of code into a file and name it runserverjs or any name you want as long as it ends with js make sure you change the two ip address to the correct ones for your network and enter your lutron login info to allow the app to authorize for the new tls server where you see ‘var oauthcode’ replace it with the code you got in step 2 place the file wherever you want and then at the command line in the same directory you saved it type ‘node runnodeserverjs’ if all goes according to plan the program will automatically generate the correct ssl certificates and use them to connect to your bridge it will detect if you have a pro bridge and attempt to connect to the telnet server as well you will see a lot of random text fly by as it sets itself up i will be cleaning a lot of that up in the future but for now don’t worry about it in the st ide under ‘my smartapps’ add the new repository ‘njschwartz lutronpro master’ from there installpublish the new service manager smartapp under ‘my device handlers’ using the same repo add the device handlers configure the smartapp on your phone or tablet finally open the st app marketplace my apps and find the lutron caseta service manager select it and then wait until it finds your server select it and choose next and wait until it finds all of your switches and pico’s select them and choose next now wait for your scenes to appear and select the ones you want hit done and done again that’s it at this point all your caseta devices should be available in st and available to control directly or via other smartapps core etc pico setup the pico’s will appear as a device in the st list however alone they cannot do anything you need to assign the buttons to a function you can use a smartapp like buttoncontroller or corewebcore to get them to do pretty much anything you could want pico button mapping additionally you can adjust some of the settings in the runnodeserverjs file to alter how the pico’s respond the buttons respond as both a pressed event and a held event you can adjust how long you have to hold a button to trigger the held event you can also adjust how a held button responds as well it can either send a single event or multiple events until the button is released this might be useful if using it to adjust the volume for example more directions can be found in the comments of the runnodeserverjs file that is about it i have tested this on a raspberry pi ubunbtu and a windows machine directions for windows pending and it all seems to work that being said i am certain bugs will be found and i will respond to them as quickly as possible so please let me know if you find any thanks for trying it outhey thanks for the post you are correct it should be npm install lutronpro i fixed it in the instructions thanks regarding the second part i am not sure about that i will have to look and see if i can find that information i haven’t messed with the new app really either so i will have to look at that as well if it is feasible to do i will certainly work on it thankswell that would explain it theni never used the room grouping so haven’t dealt with this when i get back i will look and see how that works exactly i assume the integration reports will have a field telling me what ‘room’ something is in so i can use it that way i hope interesting they did that and it broke echo thoughyou would think they would have though that through first lol bjthomas09 the issue is that the commands i am using to create the needed files don’t seem to work in windows so even if openssl is installed it doesn’t actually create the files i plan to try to figure out a way to make it work but haven’t had a chance yet your best bet in the mean time would be to try to do it on another machine and then copy the certs over to your windows box it is possible to do it on windows but you have to install openssl and then run all the commands manually for now i am not home so i cannot give you all that info at the moment or i would i promise it is something i intend to get fixed as soon as possible though snailium thanks for the bug report it looks like a connection timed out is this a recurrent issue or the first time you have seen it i think i know what this issue is but want to make sure if it is what i think it will be a pretty easy fix once i can get to my machine to address it let me know if it reoccurs and thanks againthanks snailium i never noticed that in mine but i am guessing it is because i have not setup any rooms and thus that field doesn’t exist yet if that is indeed the case though it will be easy enough to add the fully qualified name i will just have to think a bit on the best way to implement it so what you want is for the name to be called master bedroom pico door correct i will work on it as soon as i cani am away for a bit but when i get back in will be one of the first things i take care of thanks again for inputhey thanks for that info that is very interesting i will test and certainly update to support that what platform are you running it on if i might ask just interesting that this is the first time this has come up thankshey huy let me see if i understand what you are asking so for a pushed event currently the event fires as soon as the button is released you want it to fire before it is released the issue i see there is if you intended a held event and it fires a pushed event you won’t get what you want 23 i think it would be doable to send the held event as soon as whatever time threshold you select is surpassed and the send a released event once it is releasedi will need to peek at the code see i guess my question though is what exactly are you trying to do are you using the ramping features that are already built in what i mean is in that runnodeserverjs file you can specify how you want buttons to respond so instead of holding the button for 1s and releasing and getting a single held event it will continuously send the held event over and over allowing you gradual control i did this with both a light dimmer and with my sonos volume basically in webcore i told it that a held event on this button should increased the volume by say 3 then when i hold the button it sends that event over and over until i release it i should note this works ideally with the arrow button on the pico the other buttons won’t send the released event after about 7s causing a runaway ramping scenario i hope that helpslet me know if you try it or if you have and it didn’t work thanksi will certainly share my webcore pistons when i get back if needed unfortunately i don’t have access to any of that at the moment i am out to sea you have to go into the runnodeserverjs file and change how the button responds to get that stepping feature look at the example belowbasically figure out the device number of your pico and then any button that is listed as ‘true’ will use the rampingstepping feature instead of just a simple held button when the button uses the ramping feature it will continuously send the ‘held’ command as often as you want every 1s 500ms or whatever you choose then just have webcore do whatever you want each time the ‘held’ event is fired try that and let me know if you see what i am talking about let me know var buttonmethods device ‘3’ 4 true 5 trueit certainly is possible to set all of that stuff via the smartapp and then send it all over to the server on startup or a change etc the truth is i just haven’t had a ton of time to work on it so i just wanted to get it working and this was the simplest way there are probably 100 improvements

pairing button on the meter twice 2 fast presses under about 05s this worked for me it never joined my network in secure mode when pressing once but joined it securely on the first try i pressed it twice ps yes zwl means the device is not joined in secure mode the other thing is that device joined securely should have sec section in the raw description basically the first large letter is the device power modetype l is for live devices plugged directly to constant power source so your relays power meters light bulbs etc s is for sleepy battery powered devices that have to be woken up to receive communication like remotes motion sensors window sensors etc and i believe b is for beamable battery powered devices that need to be controlled in real time they wake up every few sec or so for few milliseconds to receive commands door locks for example are beamable so the hub can open them remotly the second small letter is ‘s’ for secure inclusion or blank for normal zwave inclusion

       " 'hi all like many of you i’ve been eagerly awaiting official smartthings support for the honeywell evohome heating system this was the key feature that swayed me to pick smartthings over the likes of fibaro vera or zipato however many many months later coming soon is still coming soon the beta is clunky unreliable and its development appears to have stalled it’s almost as though smartthings have invented a new meaning for the word ‘soon’ that i’ve not come across before so i bit the bullet and wrote my own smartapp and device handler see here https://github.com/codersaur/smartthings shout out to pbrain tomm dthomp13 and kohler130615 for helping with beta testing it fixes most of the issues i discovered with the official beta plus adds some new functionality too if you want to test it you’ll need to install both the evohome connect smartapp and the evohome heating zone device handler note when copying the groovy code from github don’t use the raw view as this will corrupt the degree symbols in the code copy from the standard view instead i will write some detailed documentation soon but in the meantime here’s some basic info it works in pretty much the same way as the official evohome beta app except that it stores your evohome username and password this means it can reauthenticate if the connection to evohome is lost which should make it much more reliable during my testing over the last week it’s been rocksolid evohome heating zone gui enhancements uses a multitile boost’ and ‘suppress’ buttons indicates the thermostatsetpointmode ie ‘following schedule’ or ‘temporary until ’ it will also tell you when ‘optimisation’ and the ‘window function’ are active note the layout and icons are not final if anyone can come up with a better layout let me know 20160403235116000iospng750×1334 697 kb 20160404000048000iospng750×1334 693 kb each heating zone device has the following attributes you can see it has information about the scheduledsetpoint nextscheduledsetpoint and nextschdeuledtime too the following device settings are available for each heating zone device how long setpoint adjustments are applied for eg ‘next switchpoint’ ‘midday’ ‘midnight’ for a specific duration or permanently a preset ‘boost’ temperature a preset ‘suppress’ temperature custom icon 20160403235900000iospng750×1334 70 kb additionally the following commands are available for each heating zone thermostat device auto away dayoff custom economy resume off boost suppress setthermostatmode supports all the evohome modes ‘away’ ‘economy’ ‘dayoff’ ‘custom’ etc setheatingsetpoint supports a date duration or ‘next switchpoint’ string parameter to set how long the setpoint is applied for these make it easy to configure rules using rule machine you can use the ‘mode’ commands ie auto away custom dayoff economy off without any parameters and the mode will be applied for however long you have specified in the smartapp’s settings for thermostat mode durations 20160404151402000iospng750×1334 938 kb alternatively you can explicitly specify a date parameter or a number or the string ‘permanent’ away0 set away mode permanently custompermanent set custom mode permanently dayoff2 set dayoff mode for two days ie ends tomorrow night economy2 set economy mode for two hours economy20160404t163000z set economy mode until 1630 utc on 4th april you can use the use the setthermostatmode command in a similar way setthermostatmodeoff 0 set off mode permanently setthermostatmodeaway 1 set away mode for one day ie until midnight tonight setthermostatmodedayoff 2 set dayoff mode for two days ie ends tomorrow night setthermostatmodeeconomy 6 set economy mode for six hours setthermostatmodeeconomy 20160404t163000z set economy mode until 1630 utc on 4th april note that auto and off modes can only ever be set permanently if you specify an integer number then it is interpreted as days for awaycustomdayoff modes but as hours if the mode is economy days always finish at midnight in your local timezone therefore if you want to use rule machine to set evohome to away mode eg when you leave the house and then back to auto at a later time there are a couple of ways to do it issue one command with an explicit ‘until’ value eg away2 sets away mode for 2 days or issue an immediate command to set a mode permanently eg away0 and then follow that up with another rule at a later date when you want to change the mode again eg auto note that the command resume does not change the thermostatmode it removes any temperature setpoint overrides in general i have put extensive comments in the code with usage examples for each command but let me know if anything else is unclear or if you think of some cool new features to add one key thing at the moment which i haven’t implemented is support for hot water zones as my own evohome system doesn’t have a hot water zone for me to test with therefore if any of you have a hot water zone in your evohome system and and can spare a short amount of time to help me test please pm me that’s all for now i look forward to some constructive feedback zhmm fire up the live logging tab in the ide and watch for events when you hit done i expect it will report an error of some kind copy and paste it also what country are you inyou can rename the devices without breaking anything tooparanoid got it installed and running only issue i see at the moment is the degree symbol on the temperatures shows as a ‘’ in a hexagon someone else had this issue but they also had it with some other devices which led me to believe it’s a moregeneral issue to do with how smartthings displays the degree symbol or even something general to your phone os do you have problems with the degree symbol in other devices or other apps on your phone dthomp13 did you you manage to find a fix for this either way a quick fix is just to edit the device handler code and replace all instances of the degree symbol with a c insteadparanoid not seen this anywhere else the only other devices i have are samsung movement and multis and they show the degree symbol fine ok that’s weird i just compared the ascii code of the ° in my heating zone device handler and it’s the same as the ° symbol in the smartsense multi device handler template but perhaps it’s being mangled when it’s uploaded or downloaded from github you could try opening the smartsense multi device handler template and copying the ° and pasting it into your copy of the heating zone device handler that might fix it update see this post the problem seems to be when you copy from the raw view in github try copying from the normal view insteadhas anyone tested using the android appgood to hear this is working for people fyi this is what my development queue looks like at the moment add support for hot water zones clean up icons including activeinactive states tidy up the smartapp and device settings improve the installation process to catch auth errors and allow locationscontrollerszones to be deselected enable notifications if connection to evohome cloud fails add evohome controller devices for controllerwide commands add support for communicating via a honeywell hgi80 probably via nodejs bridge any other suggestions welcome',\n",

       " 'hi all ive been working on the fibaro universal binary sensor for a while now and have finally got it to a point where it is responsive and meets all my requirements main improvements it can create two child devices for the two contact sensors and automatically updates them without a smart app and you dont need to install extra device handlers as i use the default smartthings testing ones if you change the device handler for the child contact sensors to a simulated motion sensor then the child devices will work as motion sensors instead of contact sensors it can cope with four temperature sensors and negative temperatures but might behave erratically with fahrenheit note that temperature sensors have to be connected at the point you pairinclude the ubs into smartthings otherwise it doesnt sendupdate the temperatures it can create child devices for the temperature sensors aswell without needing a smart app though it will only create them if you have received temperature information from the ubs already lots of improved debugging and logging the settings panel is vastly improved with information about each settingparameter ive given it quite a good bit of

and given it a test so far so good thanks for keeping in my enum attributes as well i tryed to add you on the github repo but couldn’t get it to work what is your details for it looks like you decided not to change the child device handlers to not allow manual changes any reason why i did try to change your original one to make a contact and motion one but you code was to complicated for me and i got a bit lost in theory is it possible to have in the dh settings tab an option that you could chose input 1 to be motion or contact then the same for input 2 tried the add child and remove and add works fine but remove will remove the contacts but only one of the temps but if you click it again it removes the other one don’t know if this is correct or not and last thing in the settings menu the last two parameters say false and false but don’t say what they do on the parent device i will keep it as two contact sensors since changing that is quite messy and may add extra delays from having to use state variables however for the child devices i will add an option to make them motion sensors and it shouldnt have a significant impact i will associate closed with motion i didnt want people to have to install multiple device handlers and i still couldnt find a published contact sensor dh which prevented manual control i will keep my eyes open though and update it if i find one realistically i dont think many people would actually press the button as they would only use the state for information in other routines so the risk of manual control is mainly the fact that it shouldnt rather than causing a problem you’re right about github integration i need to do a reshuffle of my library in order to integrate with st’s library once that is done it will allow github sync i will do it this weekend ps those two orphan settings at the bottom with no description is an st bug which is showing the previous settings from when i allowed toggling child creation in preferences screen since i removed that option it should hide the unused parameters they do go away eventually in my testingsadly publishing it for yourself does not publish it for all users hence although you have made the change and i have on my own device handlers too other users would need to import the extra device handlers themselves for a member of the public to install a device handler from a common repo i think st need to publish it will work on the changes and do an update at the same time as sorting out github integrationim going to leave it with current setup allowing state modification on the children for now after ive lived with it for a bit i will see if i actually ever accidentally change the state manually i agree it shouldnt be possible on their published devices and hence there is some merit in trying to get st to update their published dth but i guess it is useful for testing eg i dont want to have to trigger my doorbellalarm every time in order to check that it is triggering the right core routinesjust to update the thread i have modified the device handler so it should also deal with motion sensors the main device will only show contact sensors ie open and closed but after creation of the child devices you can change the device handler to be simulated motion sensor and then it will function as a motion sensor rather than a contact sensor for info it does this by sending a openclosed event to the child and also sends an inactiveactive event hence working for both types of childit will only create the temperature children if it is receiving a temperature from the fibaro do you see anything on the parent main device about temperatures was it showing temperatures before perhaps just leave it a few minutes check that all settings are entered on the settings page and then press save before pressing send config after that you should hopefully see temperatures in the device within a minute or so after the ubs sends them and then it will create the childrenif you create temperature children them it should create some child devices where each device will have one temperature that can then easily be built into rules you can then rename the parent device to have a z at the start of its name so it sits at the bottom of your things listim not sure i follow that post the 3rd is the one you are using or arent if it created three children is that not all the three you want or is it working in the main device but one of the children is misbehaving if thats the case then i suggest pressing remove children once then waiting 5s and then pressing create temp children again there is a weird bug in st that sometimes means you create children devices but they dont link to the parent correctly normally removing devices will fail to remove that broken child but if you leave the broken device there and press create temp children again then miraculously the broken child starts workingyou could also try adding the contact sensors even though you dont use them and then deleting them individually by opening up the created contact sensor devices and pressing delete at the bottom of the settingspreferences page you could even try manually deleting the temp2 sensor using the settings page and then creating the temp sensors again perhaps one of those options will trigger temp2 into working it is a very annoying bug so i will keep trying to find a workaroundah i’m an idiot i did the sum the wrong way around i will correct that tomorrow morning thanks',\n",

me know edit now supports multiple network ssidjust reading through that it looks like that still uses gps this doesn’t use gps at all and don’t have much if any effect on battery life this is only triggered by android when your wifi connection changes so this is completely wifi basedif your wifi goes down smartthings won’t be working anyways but the app would say not presentthanks let me know what you think about itif your talking about the notifications those are mostly for debugging purposes when it says false it’s probably setting your presence to not present the timeout is there if you want to wait for a certain amount of time before it changes to not present that should be at 0 unless you start to have problems with your wifi disconnecting or something the timeout is in minuteslet me know if you have any issues or ways to make it betterok thanks i will try to change that later todayupdate your device handler forgot to update github after i fixed thatwhat version of android are

       " 'hue bridge lightbulbs connected to a hue bridge are repeaters–but only for other devices attached to the same bridge they essentially form their own mini network so they won’t help with nearby sensors zwave bulbs zwave lightbulbs like those from linear and aeotec typically are repeaters – – but only for z wave these can actually be very useful in some specific use cases like getting zwave signal down basement stairs or across a garage zigbee bulbs connected directly to the st hub zigbee lightbulbs like hue or osram if connected directly to the smartthings hub without using a bridge shift from the zll profile to the zha profile and then do typically act as repeaters for other zha devices we have a number of members doing just that however many members also report that the zigbee bulbs are unreliable repeaters sometimes they clearly repeat for other zha devices and other times they don’t it may be a timing issue it certainly very frustrating because the bulbs will show on a zigbee map as a repeater smartthings engineering has investigated and determined that some of these brands including the osram have a limited buffer size which can get flooded causing messages that were due to be repeated to be lost this probably explains the intermittent nature of the problem https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/214191863-how-to-connect-osram-lightify-bulbs note osram lightify bulbs have a known firmware issue that can occasionally cause them to fail as zigbee repeaters this can potentially cause other zigbee devices to fail to update andor respond however if hue bulbs are connected without using the bridge they cannot be individually reset without using a separate device like the lutron connectable bulb remote you also need a different device handler than the official one which assumes the bulbs are connected to the bridge for these reasons smartthings support recommends using hue bulbs only with a hue bridge but some members do connect them directly because ge link lights have a known firmware issue that can cause some of them to drop off the network every few weeks they are generally not recommended as repeaters for other devices a few zigbee brands have not implemented the full protocol for bulbs and may not act as repeaters so the short answer for zigbee light bulbs is that having one directly connected to the hub may help strengthen the zha mesh but you should not use it as the only zha repeater in that zone as it may miss messages from other device classes from time to time for board discussion of some of the inconsistency issues with bulbs connected directly to the hub see the following thread whats a cheap zigbee repeater devices integrations jd do you consider bulbs a19 br30 recessed lighstrips etc as plugged in did i misinterpret your statement as inclusive of those if i did i may have caused myself a lot of grief and time wasted troubleshooting as a result osram lightify a19 bulbs pair direct to st hub devices integrations i’ve seen similar problems with ge link and wemo i did not see the problem with cree in my testing and i haven’t tested ecolink 2019 update on zigbee bulbs the ikea tradfri smart bulbs when jointed directly to the smartthings hub have now proven to be excellent repeaters but only if they have the firmware that was released mid 2018 they even work well as repeaters for xioami sensors which is unusual if purchased directly from ikea these bulbs are among the least expensive you can buy and the ikea tradfri pocket socket is also a good repeater the handheld switches dimmers controls and remotes however do not work with smartthings as of this writing wifi bulbs wifi bulbs do not act as repeaters other protocols bulbs that use their own protocol like tcp may repeat for each other but will not repeat for anything else connected to smartthings summary so many lightbulbs do act as repeaters and sometimes they are the most practical choice particularly in rooms that have a lot of potential signal blockers like cars in a garage because the bulb is typically placed much higher in the room than a pocket socket or even a light switch and consequently offers additional lines of sight but they introduce additional issues and there’s also the question of whether they are really going to be left on power all the time so i usually bring them up if the particular use case under discussion seems like it would benefit from them and otherwise not after you add any new device to your network including a bulb intended to act as a repeater you need to update the address tables or other devices will not use it more information for more information about repeaters in general see http://thingsthataresmart.wiki/index.php?title=repeaters as long as a bulb is drawing power even if it looks like it is off it will still be able to act as a repeater smart bulbs are not intended to be used with switches that cut the power completely – – this can shorten the bulb life considerably selecting switches to use with smart bulbs for discussion of the best switches to use with smart bulbs see the following faq philips hue and other smart bulbs what sort of light switches to use with them long faq wiki thinking on a big move to hue lights the real question is what switches to use with them if they’re all automatable via st and other devices do i really want to put them all on controllable switches too there’s the advantage that i can arrange to ensure those switches are on so that the the hue bulbs would be toobut it also leaves open the ability for folks to just turn them off and leave them off hmm thoughtstolik jdroberts but they introduce additional protocols and there’s also the question of whether they are really going to be left on power all the time so if the bulb is switched off using a dumb switch which cuts power to the loadbulb there is obviously no repeating done right that is correct but if you read the manufacturer instructions for the smart bulb it probably tells you that those bulbs are intended to be always powered on anyway it’s not good for the bulb to have the power cut frequently see the best switches faq linked to above – – there are several switch options that allow you to put a switch on the wall without cutting power to a smart bulbmooch91 jdroberts after you add any new device to your network including a bulb intended to act as a repeater you need to update the address tables or other devices will not use it can you elaborate once i configure a mainspowered device that should be capable of repeating i need to take some additional steps beyond just adding the device to get it to repeat it will start repeating right away you don’t have to do anything for that the issue is does it know which neighbors it should be repeating for and do those neighbors know about it there are two possible situations a you plugged the device in to the place where it will remain then you paired it at the time of pairing it took note of all the devices that were close to it so the repeater’s neighbor tables are all uptodate each device on the mesh network keeps a list of the neighbors closest to it the problem is that those neighbors don’t necessarily know that the new repeater even exists so it’s a good idea to get them to update their neighbor tables that’s why you need to do either a network heal for zigbee or a zwave repair for z wave then everybody’s neighbor tables will be uptodate and messages will be passed around in an efficient manner or b you plug the new device in close to the hub you paired it you then unplugged it and walked it over to some other place in your house and plugged it in there now we have two problems the new repeater has no idea who its real neighbors are and the neighbors have no idea that it exists the solution is exactly the same as for a – just get everybody to bring their neighbor tables up to date so you do a network heal for zigbee or a zwave repair for zwave basically anytime you’re adding new mesh devices to your network whether they’re repeaters or not once you have paired everybody and put them in their final locations you should get all the neighbor tables updated it’s easy see the range faq a guide to wireless range repeaters faqi can no longer update the first post in this thread but wanted to add another brand note sengled these bulbs will not act as repeaters so they won’t lose messages from your other zha devices but they aren’t repeaters either oddly this may make them the best choice for some people looking for zigbee bulbs connected directly to the smartthings hub but who don’t need them to be repeaters because at least they won’t mess up your network otherwise bulbs connected through the hue bridge are likely to be the most efficient and offer the most featuresroyster thank you jdroberts for this information i think i can confirm the ikea lights are also repeaters when on two buttons i have in the same area work if off at the switch the buttons are dead so i’m thinking they’ve connected to the bulbs rather than the hub before i connected them they worked fine any way around this as my other half always hits the switch the following might give you some ideas this is a clickable link faq philips hue and other smart bulbs what sort of light switches to use with them long faq wiki thinking on a big move to hue lights the real question is what switches to use with them if they’re all automatable via st and other devices do i really want to put them all on controllable switches too there’s the advantage that i can arrange to ensure those switches are on so that the the hue bulbs would be toobut it also leaves open the ability for folks to just turn them off and leave them off hmm thoughts if you mean is there a way to keep your other devices from using the ikea bulbs as repeaters the only way is to take the bulbs off power take the hub off power and take out any batteries in it leave everything else on power and leave it that way for at least 15 minutes this would cause your other zigbee devices including the buttons to go into panic mode because they can’t find the hub after 15 minutes put the hub back on power but leave the ikea bulbs off power now all the zigbee devices will start rebuilding their neighbor tables but they won’t use the ikea bulbs as a parent because those are off power and signal strength is part of the equation when the other devices are selecting a parent if it was me i would keep the ikea bulbs off power until the next day because it could take a while for all the neighbor tables to get rebuilt but a lot of people would only wait one hour it’s up to you this method should work to keep other devices from choosing the bulbs as repeaters which means if someone turns the switch off to the bulbs it won’t affect the other devices but it’s a pain in the neck and you will have to do it again anytime you add a new zigbee device or you move a zigbee device to a different location in the home or your hub has been off power for at least 15 minutes btw back to your current situation pun intended most smart bulbs are intended to always be on power the obvious reason is because that way they can hear the next command from the network but the not so obvious reason is that when you turn the switch off and then turn it back on there is a big rush of current called inrush current that’s not a major problem if it only happens a couple of times a year like when there’s an emergency power outage but if you are using a switch to regularly turn current off and on to the bulbs several times a week you can over time damage the radios inside the bulbs making expensive bulbs that much more expensive it’s not a safety issue it just means that a bulb that is supposed to last 15000 hours might only last 10000 that’s why it’s better to use one of the methods in the faq i linked to above to make sure that people are not using the switch with smart bulbs fwiwsee also the following thread which discuss a specific bulb brands and their behavior as repeaters faq best smart light bulbs to use faq an update for fall 2017 zigbee bulbs that can lose messages from your other devices over the last year a number of network problems have been reviewed by both community members and smartthings staff and it’s now been established that some but not all zigbee lightbulbs when connected directly to the smartthings hub will be marked by the network as available repeaters but will in fact fail to pass on some messages from some of your other zigbee devices this can make it seem for example like an openclose sensor is failing to report when in fact it is reporting but the bulb is not passing the message on cree bulbs seem to work ok if you have less than 10 but can start dropping messages if you have more this is an extremely annoying problem and one thaupdate for 2019 osramsylvania bulbs continue to have some problems as repeaters hue bulbs are fine acting as repeaters for each other when connected to a hue bridge but have the same problems as the sylvania when connected directly to the smartthings hub the cree bulbs don’t have the problems repeating but beginning in the fall of 2018 there’s some crazy issue with a firmware update which can cause them just to come randomly on and off much discussion in the forums on this on the other hand lots of good reports on the ikea tradfri bulbs once they are updated to the firmware released in mid 2018 they appear to be reliable not only for the typical zigbee device but even for the xioami sensors which have trouble staying connected with many other repeaters',\n",

anyone know if either works with the ge bulbs any other suggestionsnevermind not sure what i was doing the last time i tested polling i added polling to the canary bulb and it should now handle a missed canary on event also only turn the canary off if i think it is on as an added bonus you can use a cree bulb as the canary and it should work without any issues this has been committed to githubupdated the code to also poll the monitored light bulbs this should now pick up bulbs that were turned on by the physical switch and smartthings didn’t pick up the change mainly for cree bulbs

       " 'i’m new to startthings and so far love it but i’m particularly frustrated with thermostat automation seems that i can easily use automations to change thermostat temp based on time but i would like to add automations based on motion for instance between the hours of 800am and 800 pm i’d like my upstairs thermostat to change from 74 to 80 degrees if there isnt’ motion for 30 minutes on the upstairs motion sensor once there is motion i would like it to return to 74 how do i do this i tried some logic in webcore but it seems to run once and then not work after the initial timei don’t know why i didn’t think that would work but i did exactly as you have above and it works just fine i guess i had an itch to try to learn webcore thank you ill visit some of the other recommendations as well though just to learni will check it out thank you',\n",
       " 'update for 2019 they’re here now available in both the us and europe phillips hue bridge required these are self powered zigbee green energy switches which don’t need batteries they are powered by the kinetic energy that occurs when you press the switch if you’re familiar with the phillips hue tap this is the same technology in this case though phillips is not going to make the switches themselves instead they have chosen partner companies in the different regions that already make devices using this technology among others illumra in the us and buschjaeger in the eu these are the wall switches that people have been asking for to go with smart bulbs they’ll fit in the space of a regular wall switch or could just be velcro to the wall anywhere they will look like a conventional switch for those interested they will be homekit compatible as long as you are using the hue bridge we’ll have to wait to see the exact details and how integration might work with smartthings but this is a very exciting announcement cnet – 31 aug 18 this boring switch might be the best philips hue gadget yet this light switch can trigger your hue lights and scenes and itll work with homekit too best of all its selfpowered no batteries or wiring required philips more switch and luminaire partners for philips hue six new partners added to the friends of hue program offering consumers a greater choice of products that seamlessly integrate with the philips hue smart lighting system the partner companies already made the switches the only thing that’s new will be the hue bridge working with them and it already works with this technology for their own tap switch which is probably why they did meet their timeline us example the initial release in january 2019 is just under 50 per switch and they can be configured as either a two button switch which looks just like a conventional rocker or a 4 button switch which looks like 2 skinny rockers sidebyside the manufacturer site is offering them in several different colors including almond and black amazon now has all seven colors if you use the single rocker cover it’s definitely an expensive switch but some people will still want it if you use the double rocker it counts as two very intuitive switches so i think the price is not that bad if you have a good place to put it https://runlesswire.com/click_philips_hue/ https://www.amazon.com/click-for-philips-hue-white/dp/b07mmwh2yb/ eu examplediehllane i have a tap and it works well as long as you press hard enough most of my lights are on automations but when st fails it’s always good to have a backup that doesn’t require pulling out the phonetablet and opening the hue app i have buttons assigned for the main areas where i need my hue lights bedroom hallway and bathroom as well as the big button being all off if this works as well as the tap it will be a success i do wish there was an option other than the decora paddle though there may be multiple options we don’t know exactly what models will be available yet that was just one example that i pulled the article i linked to shows a different version with two skinny rockers side by sidei think this would be very popular it’s just a question of whether the smartthings hub is going to support them as part of its zigbee 30 update and if that update is going to come to the v2 and adt models as well as the v3 hubmaxxodd i love the idea but ugh that design is hideous there is also a single rocker cover which looks pretty much like every other rocker switch out theremore information from the manufacturer of the us model illumra they believe the switch might work with smartthings once smartthings has zigbee 30 support but they haven’t received any reports yet one way or the other the new v3 hub does now have zigbee 30 support the other hubs do not as yet however the illumra switches can only be set to one of four different zigbee channels and you have to manually switch between them if you aren’t using a hue bridge if zigbee 30 support is available the click for hue can be configured to transmit on 1 of 4 zigbee channels by holding one of the buttons for 10 seconds button to channel mapping is button 1 lower left bo zigbee channel 11 button 2 lower right ao zigbee channel 15 button 3 upper right ai zigbee channel 20 button 4 upper left bi zigbee channel 25 so if your smartthings hub is on a different zigbee channel you’re going to be out of luck i would go into the ide and see what zigbee channel your hub is using before ordering these tpmanleytanstarfield anyway i guess i’m going to return this still looking for that great switch that sits truly flush on the wall and can be installed next to an existing box to add on more switches that look like normal traditional switches this exists but i don’t want to drag this thread off topic see the following faq the title is a clickable link and look for the cooper switch then ask any followup questions about that switch or any of the other devices in the faq in one of the threads about that model in the forum faq full list of buttons and remotes confirmed to work with smartthings wiki i’d like to know which buttons and remotes are currently supported or might be supported in the future ideally i’d like to find something similar to the following http://www.evolvecontrols.com/devices/control-devices/glass-series though alternatively just a simple nicelooking button which actually works unlike this aeon according to amazon reviews there is an aeon key fob as well but it doesn’t seem to be very durable or stylish what else is availablethanks for the information i suspect that most people are going to be comparing this to the hue dimmer switch and the hue tap switch so it’s going to look pretty good but we’ll see if it does well we should see more competitors over time since the switches will also work with homekit as long as someone is using them through the hue bridge we should start to see an interest in the aesthetics as well for that audience',\n",

       " 'the iris smart plug is a rebranded centralite onoff plug which looks remarkably similar to the smartthings smartpower outlet in fact this is a new version of the same hardware which adds a very interesting feature a zwave plus repeater within the zigbee ha 12 plug http://www.lowes.com/pd_690407-41277-3210-l___ because this device has two different wireless protocols within it it will effectively be treated as two separate devices within smartthings the following is how you will need to pair each device and get it working within your system first the zigbee outlet in order to pair the zigbee outlet first add the devicetype at the bottom of this post to your ide once you have the devicetype added and published open the smartthings app and hit ‘connect new device’ within the marketplace after smartthings starts searching for a new device plug the iris smart plug into the wall and wait for it to be discovered by the hub it should pair as an ‘iris smart plug’ if you are having trouble getting it to pair follow the ‘zigbee reset instructions’ below optional step if you want to have this plug run locally go into your ide and switch the devicetype for the plug to the ‘smartpower outlet’ devicetype second the zwave repeater once you have the zigbee plug added into smartthings you can go back to add the zwave repeater in order to do this first start the pairing mode by selecting ‘connect new device’ within the marketplace in the smartthings app once the hub is searching for a new device hold down the button on the front of the iris smart plug until the light begins to blink this should only take a few seconds some users have reported than holding down the button doesn’t work and instead they needed to tap the button 8 times rapidly in order to get it into pairing mode once the light is blinking smartthings should discover the repeater as a ‘zwave device’ this is the proper devicetype for the repeater it will show onoff and dimming functionality within the device in the smartthings app but you can ignore this it doesn’t actually do anything and is something extra within the default devicetype at this point you should have two different devices added to your home one zigbee switch which also acts as a zigbee repeater and one zwave repeater zigbee reset instructions if the zigbee portion will not pair you may need to reset the plug in order to do this unplug the iris smart plug hold down the button and plug it back in while continuing to hold the button when the light first comes on release the button and you should now be in pairing mode open the ‘connect new device’ screen and it should instantly find the iris smart plug github.com blebsonirissmartplugblobmasterdevicetypesblebsonirissmartplugsrcirissmartpluggroovy copyright 2015

remove it from your system tewphotography did you try the general device exclusion under zwave utilities this will only work for removing the zwave repeater not the plug itself which is zigbeeperfect glad to hear thanks for the feedbackit should work exactly like the smartpower outlet i haven’t actually used the outlet other than setting it up so i’m not sure how the power reporting worksif you had previously had the zwave repeater added to smartthings then you’ll have to run a zwave exclude before pairing it back to the hub once it’s in pairing mode light blinking it should automatically

the new mobile app with this handler you have to use the classic mobile app to to change the settings and see all of it’s features this handler creates a main device aeotec doorbell 6 and creates a child device for each button that’s paired with it so you must install and publish both of the dths posted below the device supports up to 3 buttons important when the battery level drops below a specific threshold the led will start randomly flashing the battery that came with one of mind dropped really quickly but the others have been fine main device features

screenshot20190601144744png1440×2880 290 kb you can use the main device to pairunpair buttons and viewcontrol the paired buttons the main device has a bunch of settings for customizing the sound and light effect of the siren and chime you can use the slider next to play sound in the main device to easily listen to the 30 tone sounds you can use the main device to play custom chimes in shm and speaker companion by entering the sound number to play as the custom message if you specify the volume it will play the chime at that volume otherwise it will use the default chime volume setting select the main device as a switch in any smartapp and it will perform the action specified in the settings when turned on select the main device as a dimmer and set the level to 130 to play the corresponding chime sound the main device can be used as a siren strobe or both while the siren strobe or both are activated you won’t be able to play a chime or detect when a doorbell button is pressed warning because of the way the device is designed the only sound group i could use for the chime feature has a higher priority than the doorbell buttons if a chime is playing and someone pushes the doorbell button the device doesn’t send a notification to smartthings so you’ll have no way of knowing that the button was pushed technically i could work around this by disabling the tamper functionality but that would involve sending 5 zwave commands to the device every time you use the chime if most users think the extra zwave traffic potential chime unreliability and lack of tamper feature is better than missed button pushed then i will consider making the change if you have the aeotec siren 6 and decide to purchase an addon doorbell button for it you should use this handler because it has the same functionality as my siren handler but it also supports up to 3 buttons main device settings tamper alarm volume allows you to adjust the volume of the tampervibration

music player these commands allow you to specify a soundnumber to play 130 some of the commands have an optional volume parameter and if you specify the volume it will play the chime at that level these capabilities are somewhat confusing but it’s the only way i can get the chime functionality to work with the builtin apps to support all 30 sounds switch level the setlevel command plays the chime using the specified level as the sound number in the classic mobile app there’s a slider which allows you to easily scroll through all the sounds switch behavior determined by switch on action

when the physical button is pushed the switch on event is created you can also execute the switch on command to turn the device on using the sound and light specified in the settings button when this device’s physical button is pushed or the switch on command is executed the the button 1 pushed event is created refresh refreshes the battery level and firmware version pairing and removing buttons if there are buttons already paired with the device when it’s joined to smartthings it should automatically detect them and create the child devices if for some reason it doesn’t tap the main device’s refresh tile and wait a few minutes to see if they appear in the button list the main device’s details screen has a section for each button if the button is paired it will show that button device’s name an onoff tile and a remove tile the unpaired button sections show a pair tile add button click the pair tile next to the button number you want to add and then triplle click the physical button the tile will change to pairing while it’s pairing and you’ll know if it worked because the device will play a sound if you didn’t hear a sound and the tile changed back to pair try again once the pairing process stops it should show the details of the child device within 30 seconds but if it doesn’t tap the refresh tile remove button click the remove tile next to the button you want to remove the unpair process doesn’t require any interaction with the physical button and it deletes the child device so i added a confirm step in case a user accidentally taps remove when you tap remove the tile will change to confirm remove for a few seconds if you tap the tile again the button will be removed othewise the tile will change back to remove screenshot20190601145233png1440×2880 425 kb

appreciate the support and feedback i have received here with a special thanks to those that have donated at https://www.paypal.me/krlaframboise it is not required or expected but it does motivate me to continue creating new dths and enhancing the dths i’ve already createdsergl looking at this for possible purchase can 1x button talk to multiple siren 6 units for example have a siren unit in each room but all fed from the 1x button not easily but you can use smart lighting to turn on the others when the button is pushedhkolberg hi could you perhaps confirm if it is possible to upload custom sounds to the doorbell 6 thanks no it’s not the gen5 doorbell allows you to do that but the doorbell 6 only allows you to play the 30 builtin sounds the intercept repeat and repeat delay settings give you more control over how it sounds and the doorbell 6 is much more reliable than the gen5marcmale my doorbell run fine for 2 days but today it’s frozen the status is offline and the light is solid on i try reboot my hub without succes i disconnect the power of doorbell unit but light stay on and don’t reboot the doorbell any idea the only way to reboot the device is to unplug it and wait for the internal battery to die which takes about 6 hours the status offline means that st thinks the device is offline but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it is have you tried tapping the off tile assuming you’ve tapped the off tile to ensure that the strobe isn’t active pressing the physical doorbell button should cause the device to make a sound because the button communicates directly with the device if that doesn’t work then it sounds like you received a bad device and you should contact aeotecnbaynews installed both device handlers the bell works with the button outside of smartthings the bell button does not show in the app that it is paired i try to pair with the button 1 pair tile it says pairing then nothing tried refresh still nothing what am i doing wrong two hours into this process why does this have to be so difficult i just want a doorbell that actually rings and works with smart things click pair and then quickly push the doorbell button twice what firmware version does it show on one of the tiles at the bottom of the screennbaynews the light on the siren is breathing that happens when it thinks the battery in button is low remove the device push action button 6x factory reset it hold action button for 20 seconds and then join it again once it’s joined push the pair tile for button 1 triple click the physical button and see if that solves the problemtedrpi any reason why my settings in the doorbell dth would not be syncing i’ve saved the changes and the main screen shows 1 pending change if hit the sync button i see the box display syncing but then it returns to show 1 pending change the sync tile resends all the settings to the device so most of the time you’re better off opening the settings and saving again so that just the changes get sent to the device if that doesn’t work open live logging save the settings again and then post the logging results so i can see the setting and value that’s not being savedthekholm can i diactivate the door button controller at a specific time frame so that the chime doesn’t sound late evening or night if someone pressing i implemented the volume level as a setting instead of a custom command so at the moment that’s not possible implementing it both ways leads to the setting value not matching the device’s actual volume and if it was only implemented as a custom command then all users would have to use a custom smartapp like core if they want to change the volumethekholm can i diactivate the door button controller at a specific time frame so that the chime doesn’t sound late evening or night if someone pressing if you make the changes below to the aeotec doorbell 6 button handler you should be able to use the custom smartapp core or webcore to change the volume using the custom setvolume

       " 'first post here after spending many hours reading through the very valuable contributions here i think i’ve arrived at the right conclusion but want to check first our new house has 3 sets of outside lights all with separate switches in different parts of the house none of which have neutral wires we are adding a fourth set of lights running from the power source in the garage as that will be far far simpler than adding to an existing run of lights what i’d ideally like is to be able to control these from my phone and to be able to be set automations for these currently we have c 10 wifi plugs running internally controlled by the smart life app 98 of the time it’s set and forget but it’s very useful to be able to turn on and off remotely i’m not set on smart life as the sole single app i already use link tap for my watering system but that would be an added bonus i’m not set on wifi per se either if it’ll connect somehow smart life says it supports zigbee for example questions from reading i think i can’t simply replace the existing switches as there isn’t a neutral wire i’ve read about adding a micro in line but i’m not clear where i could add in this setup unless there is space in the lights themselves and i could ensure they were weatherproof or have i misunderstood are there any alternatives i think the answer is no but hoping i’m wrong for the new switch i assume there will be a neutral wire available so that should be more straight forward ha ha ha like everything has been in this house so farnot thanks in advance for any help given',\n",

       " 'wanted to thank all the people who’ve commented on the probably highly stupid questions i’ve posted so far and the help i’ve received and passed along to our team as we’ve drunk ourselves into oblivion coping with smartthings if you’re a new dev on the community forum or starting out with the platform maybe this might help you to navigate some of the obstacles and pitfalls i originally wrote this as an internal post for onboarding programmers transferring from other projects it’s slightly tongueincheek and doesn’t cover everything but it’s a reasonable summary imo to get you through day 1 monday morning confusion devils lane – 28 may 20 battling with samsung smartthings iot a lesson in the importance of youve suffered youve gone round in circles youve reread the same page multiple times youve even drawn it out on a few whiteboards youve read it again youve tried to code around it youve discussed it then you came back round and had toi wish i’d known that i will update it after i’ve finished these bottles of scotch and finished crying by then i should be at the forgiveness stage of grief so they tell mei really appreciate a lot of these points and the time taken to provide them thank you but i have to disagree the reason being to do with the confusion apparent in the flawed conceptual framework attempted with the smartthings architecture simple things are selfevidently simple and there is so much confusion in all of this which is not apparent in other systems possessing far more complexity a developer doesn’t need to read an faq about how twitter’s api works for example that’s the reason i added a note about it not being the technically accurate way to describe how it works you’re absolutely right it’s not firmware however for all intents in purposes in the developer’s eyes it is performing the same role conceptually that’s where i’m aiming we have to find ways to onboard people using concepts they are familiar with already firmware might be the wrong choice of wording here but it’s a loose kind which conceptually fits not technically accurate but a way of communicating what’s going on the ide isn’t an ide by any definition at all eclipse is an ide it speaks volumes that a web interface to your account is supposed to be a simple definition honestly it’s entirely unclear what it is and this entire section of st needs to be rethought it may be technically brilliant but unless it’s for use by extraterrestrials us ordinary humans aren’t going to be cheering it on any time soon again you’re absolutely right it’s not a plugin i’m back on the conceptual level when i visually show a dev a host program smartthings app and their piece of code is something listed in it the nearest analogue which comes to mind mentally is a plugin nobody can seem to define what a smartapp is jdroberts with the new platform you are supposed to host your own smartapp and then connect to your smartthings account via web hooks this is an example of where the whole thing goes way off the rails the smartapp in question is someone’s normal web app in ruby python laravel go we already have a name for it webhooks are used every day for cideployment api callbacks etc to put it bluntly twitter twilio nexmo sparkpost or any other provider don’t refer to 3rd party appsplatforms invoking their api as twitapps twilapps nexapps or sparkapps they’re just web apps processing multiple post webhooks from differing sources the reason i’m pointing that out is to illustrate where smartthings differs in its understanding of how the relationship between providers and developers has changed since windows 98 how many versions are we going to have from this multibillion dollar giant company before it it’s final and works like most people expect it toalso see if this helps any on the original platform a smartapp is a program that someone wrote from scratch to perform a function on the smartthings platform people were also allowed to copy a program from someone else and use it on their own account this is my point all of this is massive overengineering why is there even a conception of a smartapp at all it’s just a client connecting with oauth2 is it a twitapp because it uses twitter’s apibose uses neither zigbee nor zwave the capabilities for both the old and the new platform are intentionally removed from the protocols that the device actually uses they are an abstraction layer that smartthings provides ish it’s referred to as a lan connection just as philips hue is ours connects over wifi which in itself isn’t accurate the setup is done over a selfhosted ssid and the product itself claims it is controllable over bluetoothwifi wifi is technically a lan but again terminology lans are typically associated with ethernet when was the last time anyone went into a lan cafe do you put a password in to connect to an encrypted lan is there an ethernet cable plugged into the speaker we have 20 devices in the lab noone has the time to be figuring out what smartthings actually means however also true bose doesn’t work with smartthings it can’t switch the speaker on or off mute adjust volume or anything useful it barely reports the online power status correctly however it’s listed on the works with smartthings site and the smartthings api reports capabilities for the device which aren’t in the list or even usable wouldn’t it be more honest to put it in the we try our best to talk to it but no promises sectionmy tone might be inaccurately be coming across as intemperate or uncharitable for which i apologise i think the larger discussion here is worthwhile and seemingly been coming for a long time there may be some confusion because of the target audience of the article you’re an expert on this stuff and the people i’ve been using it to train are absolute beginners would cloud driver be more appropriate then in your view i added that as an alternative but i’m still not clear even with the point about bose does this thing even know what it is my sense is the smartthings developer ecosystem is a bit of an awkward inconvenience to samsung it’s like some management board looking at it thinking why would we want 3rd parties when someone can use our app oh yeah it’s fashionable we’ll add that so we can get more people to sign up for a samsung accounti’d question that your contributions here are brilliantly helpful the classic faq is a bit confusing though maybe needs an update jdroberts and yeah smartthings staff have said multiple times in this forum that the majority of their customers have 15 or fewer devices and never use any custom code at all which begs the question why put this degree of work into a developer ecosystem which is this complex the logic of that is definitely corporate because of how circular it is we don’t have customers to develop it for but won’t have until we develop it i look at this with outside eyes and share the opinion we generally have internally about 15 guys of whom 4 are tasked with st on a project this could be so simple why isn’t it just build it into a sort of online studio and use oauth in the same way everyone else does with some tutorials arduino is crazy complex but it’s a lot easier and more enjoyable to work with even if you have to learn c take the clever stuff out a la python philosophy and make it fun',\n",

       " 'i have a smartthings hub v2 and a number of zwave devices that work fine i also have amazon echoetc and added the smartthings skill which enables voice control of my smartthings devices i recently added a samsung smartthings button zigbee and it also works fine however i cannot figure out how to get the amazon echo to discover the button it doesnt seem to have a category within the alexa app and when i ask the app to discover devices it doesnt find any do i need to put the button in some sort of discover mode or am i simply missing somethingi see i was actually trying to use alexa as a middleman so that the smartthings button would trigger nonsmartthings devices that are known to alexa eg kasa switches rather than implement the kasa integration that i have seen online i was hoping for a simpler solution – ie trigger alexa upon recognizing the button press via smarthings to control a kasa device known to alexa i created a smartthings routine which alexa could discover even though the routine did nothing but i cant find a way for alexa to perform an alexa routine based triggered by the smartthings routine alexa has a device trigger but it just says i dont have any supported devices even though alexa knows about my kasa devices as well as my smartthings devices is there a way to accomplish this without greater hassle than a custom kasa integration – which would only solve the problem for kasa devices not other devices that smartthings doesnt yet supporti did that and followed the instructions in the wiki except for the code part since i used the virtual device creator alexa now shows my virtual switch as a device of type switch but when i create an alexa routine and select devices as a trigger i still get the same message we were unable to find any supported devices i even tried the disable smartthings skill log outin alexa account then rediscover devices same result am i missing somethingi see i’m fairly new to using the ide am i creating a device or a device handler or both i see how to create a simulated contact sensor but not how to integrate that code just need a little direction on the order of steps to create this device from the supplied codesurprisingly i figured it out works like a charm thanks very muchmost of my confusion stemmed from the fact that the ide uses the term device handler and device type interchangeably when a device handler is created and published by you the manufacturer of a physical device or someone else it is automatically added to the device type popup that you use to add or change the device handler of a device in the ide for physical devices you can change their device handlers by editing the device and selecting a different device type the only difference in this case is you have to create a virtual device in the ide so once you create and publish the device handler using the included code your device handler called alexa switch is now available as a device type you then create a new device in the ide ie a virtual device and select the device type alexa switch at this point your virtual device will show up in the smartthings app you can create as many of these virtual switches as you want now you have a physical device your smartthings button and a virtual device of type alexa switch both of which show up in the smartthings app you then connect them by causing the physical button device to trigger the changing of the state on or off of the virtual device in my case i used an automation via the smart lighting smart app because it allows triggering of actions this allowed me to select an action of my physical button device eg double push to trigger the changing of the virtual device state i used the toggle feature so i only needed to create a single automation in other words a doublepush of the button will toggle the physical device between on and off and vice versa at this point i followed the instructions in the wiki page above to cause the alexa app to recognize the virtual switch in the device button when creating an alexa app routine in my case i created two alexa routines for two different actions – one that is triggered when the virtual switch is open and another that is triggered when the virtual switch is closed since alexa thinks this is a door contact sensor so when i double push my smartthings button this toggles the state of my virtual switch which triggers the relevant one of my two alexa routines eg toggling a device on and off i did this to toggle a device kasa outlet that alexa recognizes but is not compatible with smartthings though i am now looking at someone who created a smart app to integrate kasa devices with smartthings hope all of this isnt too confusingmy virtual device also has a description of samsung contact sensor in the alexa app as for the type you can edit this i have a choice of light or switch not sure if it matters but i selected switch if you create a new alexa routine select the trigger when this happens and then click on the device icon does your virtual device show up or do you get the no supported devices message if it shows up it should give you open and close options if you get the no supported devices message then you may have made a mistake in following the instructions on the wikihappy to pass it forward glad it worked',\n",

new temperaturei contacted netatmo support team to report that issue and bellow you can find the response hello thank you for contacting netatmo customer service my name is daegil and i will be in charge of your ticket the temperature measurement interval of 6 hours is linked to how the third party application was coded our devices update the new data to our servers every 10 minutes smartthing would need to change the update rate on their side unless they planned a setting to change that please contact smartthings support directly they will be able to let you know if they planned a possibility to change this update rate feel free to let me know should you have any further request have a lovely day daegil technical specialisti just brought netatmo product because of the compatibility with the smartthings i cant understand why i need to deliver messages between netatmo and samsung to resolve that issue that should be resolved internally without my implicationi partially i agree with you but the problem is that in the official page of smartthings is advertised that the neatmo thermostat is supported so if you take the responsibility of the compatibility in my opinion there are 3 possible solutions in this case samsung need to resolve the issues for each product that is advertising the compatibility samsung need to make quality control to each device and delete it for the list if it’s not fulfilling the criteria of the compatibility samsung need to stop false advertising with other products conclusion is that i bought samsung smartting hub in order to integrate all my devices in the same ecosystem and i find myself in the situation that the automations are not working and the heating is not following the rules installed which not only causes discomfort but also a higher gas bill i don’t think its fair that in these type of misunderstandings between samsung and compatible products it’s the customer who ends up paying even thought it has no blame ps in my observation apple doesn’t have such issues on homekit appplease find bellow the second email from netatmo support team when i told them that the problam is from their side hello again are you sure that it is not smartthings saying that they are compatible with us to explain better we offer a free api so any third party can decide on their own if they wish to be compatible with us or not this means that we cannot track and take responsability for every third party application features bugs or other there are only a few ones where we do such as homekit alexa google home to name a few and they are displayed on our website in other words as far as i know we have no way to raise an internal ticket with smartthings or an exclusive partnership thank you for your understanding best regards daegil technical specialistand it is true netatmo is not advertising in their site compatibility with samsung smartthing to explaining better is the same situation like google nest api in 2019 if i am not wrong they decided to change the api and make migration to google account this results to all the 3rd party apps like ifttt to do not work and now it is 3rd party apps responsibility to integrate their apps to the new api provided by google so if samsung is advertising compatibility with other products is taking responsibility to fix the issues otherwise samsung will have legal repercussion for falls advertisingi got response from samsung no explanation why they cant change it i am very disappointed for the customer care fiona smartthings may 5 446 am mst hi ag hope you’re

       " 'rooms occupancy and rooms manager while st has a concept of rooms it is essentially a grouping mechanism which does not enable personalized automation in contrast rooms occupancy considers the room as a meta device and automates common tasks associated with a room physical or virtual what makes it really useful is not just the rooms occupancy state but the ability to manage automation for rooms in a set of rules for the room based on the occupancy state of the room and data from various sensors when creating a room device through the smartapp you are able to create these rules for the rooms making your rooms really smart what these rules enable is many common tasks around rooms which most users go through automating at some point usually through setting up a few rules or creating a few pistons i have been there and done that myself while those work to a degree it does not enable the kind of comprehensive automation that should be possible for devices in a room based on sensor and device inputs this smartapp makes that possible if there is one principle that these apps are built on it is that your home automation should work in the background in a repeatable and predictable manner without requiring periodic human intervention in short your automation should work for you and not the other way around but even more importantly perhaps this app gets you the kind of waf for your home automation that you have always dreamed about 🙂 you can continue reading here for the summarized version or read the more detailed and always the latest version on github which also describes the individual settings rooms manager and rooms occupancy readme on github additionally these room devices also have attributes capabilities and commands which are useable in webcore or other smartapps like smart lighting in st or rule machine in hubitat there is a range of other automations that webcore makes possible that could not otherwise be done without writing a custom smartapp for it i use webcore for that and am i big fan of adrian so checkout webcore as well if you dont already use it how does this app work this app works by setting rooms occupancy to various states based on a set of sensors as specified by the user it takes this state and attribute values from various sensors and evaluates a set of rules that you create to match the conditions when all of the conditions for the rule matches it executes actions specified on these matching rules as an example you can specify motion sensors in occupied settings to set a room state to occupied when there is motion from any of those motion sensors then create a rule to turn on some lights in this rule you could also set that these lights should only be turned on if a lux sensor is at a certain lux value or lower or you could specify that only turn on the lights during certain times or you could specify turn on the lights at a certain level during certain times and at another level during other times as a part of the occupied settings you can also specify timeout values so the room does not indefinitely stay set to occupied state and the lights turn off after a while when there is no motion how quickly that happens is controlled by you through the timeout value you specify in the settings by specifying settings in the checking settings you are also able to dim the lights before the lights turn off completely so there is a visual cue to the room occupant that the lights will turn off because they have not moved in a while off course you may be in the room while and not be moving for a while like reading a book or watching tv thats when you use the engaged settings to set the room to engaged state see below for additional details here are the common room occupancy states occupied occupied is you go to a room are in there for a few minutes then leave the room lights come on when you enter the room and turn off after a couple of minutes of your leaving the room think of occupied as a transient state and engaged below as a somewhat persistent state engaged engaged is when you stay in a room for an extended period of time and may be motionless for some or all of the time since we cant depend on the motion event for engaged state there are different options to set the room to engaged for extended occupancy these are all under engaged settings and there is more coming but these help make sure the switches you set to on stay on even if there is no motion in the room when in engaged state you have a different and longer timeout state than the occupied state so there is still a motion requirement but a much higher time threshold than the occupied state asleep asleep state is meant for use while the room should be asleep as in not respond to most typical automation like motion automation but it does allow for other automation like using a night light and using a button to turn on or off the night lights you are still able to create rules for the asleep state but it additionally support a little bit for asleep state specific automation in the asleep settings vacant vacant state is for when the room is vacant and you want everything to get turned off it is possible to setup rules for vacant settings as well but not required checking checking state is used for transition between states and not user controlled for example when moving from occupied to vacant occupancy state the room will transition to checking state while the app does not allow creating rules for checking state there is some settings available to control dimming of the lights when in checking state locked locked state disables all automations for the room and allows you to control lights and other devices in the room either manually or some other way the states locked reserved kaput and donotdisturb are effectively all similar in that they all disable automation that being the case there is some sensors allowed to set unset rooms to from locked state but no other automation beyond that for these occupancy states here is a quick description of the various top level settings and how the app works at the heart of the app is the concept of room states and rules to automate devices based on these rooms states and other sensor inputs in the following description when i talk about sensors it refers to devices that have attributes which are used to drive decisions in the rooms rules note many of these settings are optional but when specified will require other settings to be specified like specifying a motion sensor is optional but if you do specify a motion sensor the motion event to trigger timeout countdown becomes required top level settings room devices room sensors used in checking rule conditions based occupancy state and data from these sensors the next 6 settings group are for how the room is set to each of those 6 occupancy states and settings specific to that occupancy state occupied settings settings that specify how this occupancy state is set normally it is based on motion but there are also other ways of detecting occupied state like a specific switch turning on available settings engaged settings settings that specify how this occupancy state is set normally it is based on motion but there are also other ways of detecting engaged state like a button being pressed vacant settings settings that specify how this occupancy state is set normally it is based on motion but there are also other ways of detecting occupied state like a specific switch turning off asleep settings settings that specify how this occupancy state is set asleep is tricky because there is no true commonly used physical asleep sensors so these settings allow other ways of setting asleep occupancy state and specifying night light settings which are a little different from how lights work through the rules night lights settings for night lights with motion while in asleep state locked settings settings that specify how this occupancy state is set this state disables all automation for the room these group of settings allow for light routine settings used in the rules auto level al settings settings to specify auto level and color temperature settings for the room which allows using al as a light level rule to automatically calculate and use these values based on time of day wake and sleep time specified holiday lights hl settings settings to specify holiday light patterns for use in rules during various holiday seasons allows for rotating colors through or slow twinkling any set of lights specified in the rules temperature settings is their own group temperature settings manage temperature settings for the room in conjunction with thermostat or switch controlled room ac andor heater after adding temperature settings remember create temperature rules in maintain rules so the app can automate temperature control based on these rules here are the rest of the settings starting with the heart of the app maintain rules which allows you to maintain automation rules for the room and turn them in to smart rooms maintain rules heres where to create the rules that check room occupancy state various sensor values and other variables to decide which lights and switches should be turned on or off it also allows executing a piston or routine or even starting and stopping a music player based on the rules while date acts a filter when checking rules for match time works as a trigger so if you wanted your outdoor lights to turn on and off at certain times everyday you would create 1 rule with those times and lights to turn on and off at right times you could also use this feature in combination with date filtering and with or without holiday light hl settings above for different color settings for different holidays adjacent room settings adjacent rooms allow specifying which rooms are adjacent to that room so you can automatically turn on lights in the next room when moving through this room mode and other settings miscellaneous settings that dont fit any where else like in which modes should all automation be disabled or what icon to use for the room in the rooms manager and a few other settings view all settings what the name says this only describes a part of whats possible through this app for more details please see each group of settings for a room in the

       " 'hi i am interested in direct http protocols that alexa supports for controlling smart home devices like bulbs plugs without any installed skills in the cloud as an example i know alexa supports native phillips hue protocol here a github project where someone implemented fictive api so alexa thinks you have a hue at home and can control it via voice same thing with wemo devices as posted here i know that today the recommended way is to create an alexa smarthome skill register it in amazon create a lambda instance pay for traffic and communicate with your home via separate channel etc i would like to avoid that and implement pure simple http api which alexa recognizes via wifi on local network and can control it so my question is what other http protocols does alexa support similarly as hue or wemo especially are some of those protocols public and easy to implement i could use the wemo protocol but this is very limited so i am searching for better alternatives that are not so hacky at the same time i want to keep it very simple and especially avoid the need of having an alexa skill implemented and instantiate a lamda for that in amazon that would communicate with my smart gateway from outside of my home network i am fine with the fact that alexa communicates with amazon cloud i have problem with the alexa skills communicating via a separate channel many thankshi ryan thanks for your reply i am aware of zigbee but this needs extra hardware as you mention i have echo plus but it would be tricky to make my raspberry support the zigbee i can confirm that alexa supports at least one native http protocol hue harmony i was able to start the api locally and make alexa think i have smart bulbs at home i was wondering if there are other similar protocols i found something with ikea but i am not sure if this works locally on the other hand i read as well that the alexa gen 2 does not work reliably with the hue protocol so probably amazon is going away from the native protocols which is sadyep in that point you are right sorry i placed my question in confusing way alexa needs the cloud to understand the speech no problem with that i just want to avoid any extra skills that need a cloud instance and communicate from there with the smart gateway from outside of my network i will rephrase my question to make it more cleari just found another protocol that works locally wemo device again this one is very limited and needs a quite hacky way for the implementation here the description it would be great if alexa would support some well defined rest interfaceby locally i mean that alexa echo dot or plus the device physically communicates on local network with the smart devices without making the trip over skills in cloud according to the official documentation for smart skill api and this image alexa cloud communicates via skill in the cloud with the cloud instance of the smart home company which then communicates with the gateway in your home network which then delegates the commands on the smart devices in contra to that philips hue and wemo work differently if you say alexa discover devices the alexa echo device will directly communicate inside of your home network with the wemohue device over wifi this means no skill no lambda functions in amazon no open ports to your network etcafaik alexa is indeed capable of communicating with hue devices without any skill connected with your alexa account i managed this couple months ago with the hacked hue interface those are quite old devices that alexa started supporting in the early stages when alexa was new on market later i managed to develop a working smart home skill for alexa according to the official documentation for that you need an amazon account cloud skill and especially a gateway which can communicate with the cloud skill from your home network which means lot of overhead the key difference is in the data flow in case of huewemo the packets travel amazon alexa device in case of the newer cloud based solutions the packets travel amazon alexa skill cloud smart server local gateway device what do you mean by smartthings do you mean it as a general term for all smart devices or does smartthings mean some specific device or protocol that works the same way as wemothank you for your patiente until now as said i rephrased my question to make it clear of course amazon lives in cloud and alexa communicates with that cloud i have no problem with that fact this was a typo from me sorry for the confusion i want to achieve a solution where the network traffic between alexa and smart home gateway will be a direct hop in local network alexa smart gateway and yes alexa can use amazon cloud for the speech translation i already implemented the standard solution using aws lambda skills but this needs another channel from the cloud to your network traffic costs in aws lambda paid account in amazon and an extra cloud application as well paid communicating with your home gateway so long story short i want to implement exactly the wemo solution as linked in the question i was just hoping meanwhile there is a better official protocol in place that alexa would supportmany thanks it is sad that echo probably does not support more local protocols exactly huewemo protocol is very limited so i was hoping for a better one i fear the reason why is that is the business model behind the scenes companies have to pay to amazon money when connecting the alexa smart skills calculated on request basis i can imagine samsung has to pay quite a lot for smartthings considering how many users they have and additional fees apply for the smart cloud app companies have to maintain unfortunately this architecture has a big negative effect users have to trust a 2nd company beside amazon to access their home network as the cloud skills need a 2nd channel from the cloud i am striving for a simpler solution avoiding that the reason why alexa supports locally hue and wemo is probably the fact that they were on market before alexa and amazon needed this for marketing purpose to attract first customers now they are probably closing the support slowly and forcing companies to use the cloud skills thanks for the hint with alexa future in terms of local commands without internet i was not aware of that in order to make this work alexa would need to support some local apis which should be possible to implement easily so there might be a hope i will have a deeper look into that i will have a look as well in the amazon developer forum as you suggest i saw in this forum questions related to similar topic with alexa so i thought this forum is related to any smart devices sorry for the spam here',\n",

       " 'i have left most the original from the top down however near the bottom of the main post you can see i’ve made alot of changes and show the transformation from then to now i did however remove the original video and updated it on 09142018 i’ve seen a lot of posts lately asking about pool pumps lights temps and valves etc these questions are being asked a lot because there isn’t a lot of information or products out there that work with this kind of thing when i moved in i got a quote from a pool guy to automate the pool valves and they told me that it would be at least a grand to automate pool stuff and i don’t even think that would have been that powerful or integrateable into smartthings after a while i decided that i like and enjoy diy projects and this could be some fun i didn’t understand arduino programming when i started and the whole realm was really intimidating but figured i could learn as i went by reading on the web asking questions on forums watching videos etc anywho i have decided that my diy pool controller has hit a level far enough that it is worth sharing this project has come a little at a time and so far does variable speed pump control outside air temperature power use valve control pool light color control pool water temperature pool water level automated water fill valve and water use in the future i envision it growing into possible ph sensing and chlorine sensing with automatic dispensing for a completely hands free pool the first part of the project and the brains of the operation is a particle photon which is a wifi arduino that is extremely easy to work with this controls an 8channel relay with octocuppler so that it can work with mixed voltages with no mixing of the voltages i have 24 volt ac pool valve actuators and and also 12 volt dc ball valves the 120 volt pool light also connects to the relay board so all 8 channels are used as follows for me ch1 floor cleaner valve on 24vac ch2 floor cleaner valve off 24vac ch3 pool aerator on 12vdc ch4 pool aerator off 12vdc ch5 pool pump speed control 12vdc ch6 pool pump speed control 12vdc ch7 pool pump speed control 12vdc ch8 pool light 120vac the pool pump has 8 selectable speeds based on combinations of on or off from the three relays and these combinations were right in the manual for my hayward tristar 3202 vsp pump so there was no trial and error required to figure out their relay control i also have a ds18b20 temp probe for measuring outside error temp and sensing a value to smartthings every ten minutes the pool light i purchased cycles colors when turned on and off quickly this made it easy to program color selection within the photon the second part of the project is the water valves i have ball valves and flow sensors hooked to a second battery backed up photon so that water valves don’t get left on in the event of a power outage and i can measure and dispense calculated amounts of water i also hooked my patio misters up to this same photon with a y splitter at the water spiggot so i can also turn on my patio misters the third part is a battery powered sesnor i made from a third photon that has a vl53lox laser distance sensor for pool water level and a ds18b20 temp probe for pool water temperature this all tucks neatly under a skimmer basket lid and wakes up every 4 hours to send a new reading then sleeps for energy conservation i have attached a quick video of the whole schebang in action cheers here’s a screenshot of my device handler and action tiles pannel for the pool edit i have edited the device handler to a new look second edit i added the ability to control my valves all from the one device now and included optional virtual switches to stir chemical for set time

bscuderi13smartthings development by creating an account on github for my normal pump run schedule control and refreshing i use webcore to tie all of it together basically anytime you see a particlepublish in my code its triggering a webhook to refresh a device in webcore edit i’ve added this little video showing the guts and conceptually explaining the wiring not wire by wire but should give you a good idea of what i did i also am adding this little blurb to kind of supplement the video okay lots of people have asked about the wiring i’m not sure how to go about it so unless i drew a bunch of schematics and did it wire by wire there is no good way to show this but i am updating the original post to include a video showing the guts of each thing i tried to kind of describe the wiring and parts conceptually with the video but this isn’t going to have every wire or anything as i’m sure it will be a mess and hard to tell or remember for that matter so i will just assume a basic understanding of electrical stuff and show what i did but its important to realize that there isn’t a one size fits all approach to wiring since everyone’s pool equipment pad may be different i will use this writing to kind of supplement the video the main pump controller i have a gfci outlet on my pool equipment pad downstream of this so everything is gfci protected i added the three tap electrical chord this has two things plugged into it 1 a 24 volt ac transformer to control the jandy valves i send one leg of this to the relay first pig tailed so i can split it and send it to two relays one for open one for close if you have more jandy valves you obviously would have more in your pigtail 2 a 12 volt one amp dc power supply i pigtail the positive leg of that 6 ways one leg goes to my step down usb converter power supply thing not a technical term basically it takes the higher voltage ie 12 and steps it to five volts clean usb power supply to supply the photon i did this so i didn’t have to have yet another power supply plugged in i found that board on amazon the other 5 wires from my pigtail go to the relay board one for open of my 12volt valve and one for close of the 12 volt valve and the other 3 go to the relays for pump speed control the pump speed control didn’t require 12 volts there was a whole acceptable range of power it could sense this is just what i used since i already had a 12 volt source the 8th relay is my pool light the power source is 120 volts again from downstream of the gfci outlet so my pool light is also gfci protected i don’t think i showed it in my video but the relay board itself is powered from the 5 volt pin from the photon i also have the outside air temp probe on there i forgot to show but it is powered from one of the digital pins on my photon i cant remember which one you would have to refer to my code as far as the temp level sensor the laser distance sensor on mine is able to be powered with anything from i think 28 volts to 5 volts so i just power it again with a digital pin from my photon which is a 33 volt source the temperature probe is also powered from one of the digital pins the photon itself is powered from an 18650 battery that first it goes to a lithium charging board i got on amazon in a five pack for like 2 bucks its a simple circuit the only other things i added was a power switch to turn it on and off and the 47k resistor that is required for the temperature probe to function properly the water valves and flow sensor setup is powered from an 1860 lithium battery again so it can continue in a power outage and not leave valves open and water on on the input side of that charger board i have a 5 volt dc power supply so it runs off mains power keeping the battery topped if their is power outflow from that is split up one side goes to a step up usb buck converter i have that takes the lower voltage output from the battery and steps it up to a clean 5 volt usb supply for the photon the other side of that goes to the boost converter to step up the voltage to 12 volts for the valves this is then switched at the relay to open and close valves the relay board itself is powered off the 5v pins on the photon the 5 volt pins on the photon also supply power to the flow sensors that require five volts to run hope this helps edit 52418 okay so for everyone following this project i finally found some time to tinker and i have incorporated a whole lot more into my project the changes are as follows i cut out the old abandoned water line and plumbed right into my old autoflll line so there is no more hose in the pool but a dedicated line that my photon turns on and off to dispense and measure water directly into the pool big improvement getting rid of the eye sore of a hose changed my jandy valve to actually have three way programming now using two relays this allowed me to shut off all main returns and only send water to the aerator allowing me to run the aerator at a way lower pump speed and consequently save money here in phoenix in the summer i have to run my aerator alot to keep the pool cool because the aerator line is so small i put some pump speed protections coded in to keep from accidentally putting too much pressure into the small 12 inch line changed my device handler to show an intuitive three way valve to match my three available positions of main returns floor cleaners and aerator only the aerator valve itself which is the 12 volt 12 inch ball valve style valve i decided after some tinkering that i only needed full open or closed and no intermediate positions therefore i freed up a relay by changing my code and wiring the close to the nc position and the open wire to the no position on a single relay instead of two now i’m either full open or close the biggest and most exciting change is chemical injections i have added two 15 gallon chemical drums with stenner peristaltic pumps one for muriatic acid since my pool ph creeps up and a second for liquid chlorine i hate flaoting the pucks as they add too much stabilizer to the pool rendering the chlorine useless i wont get into cynaurics here but i’ve been manually dosing my pool with liquid chlorine daily or every other day or so if you are interested in why checkout www.troublefreepool.com since following the practices here my pool is always sparkling clear and cheap on the chemicals obviously i wanted to get this process automated as work will keep me gone more this summer than normal making it so i cant dose the pool to set this up i needed two relays and i only had one left on my 8 relay board good news is i had a single relay kicking around i used to tinker with projects so i wired that up to my photon and i was good to go my wiring method on these was i took out the gfci outlet on my pool sub pannel and instead put a gfci breaker on the circuit i then took a regular outlet and snipped the brass jumper conncetor thing on the hot side which separates the top outlet from the bottom now i hooked up each outlet to my relays this just allowed me to plug the stenner pumps right into the now controlled outlets instead of modifying the pumps chord and possibly voiding warranty this also looks cleaner for the pumps run schedule i figured that i could afford no errors here and therefore did not want to rely on smartthings for scheduling as if a pump failed to shutoff i could pump way way too many chemicals into the pool so for the scheduling i handle it locally on the photon my device handler for the chemical pumps just merely shows which pump is on or not and also allows me to change the daily targets and i can also set a manual run with a timer that is also internally handled once the request is received running the stenner pumps locally as well as the discussions above where some of you thought that the pump and valve schedule itself would be better run internally rather than relying on webcore for my regular pump schedules got me thinking that i might as well program my pump and valves internally as well so that is what i did it was easy to do now smartthings shows whats happening and i can manually over ride but i have an automatic mode that internally schedules its own runs then just refreshed the device in smartthings to show its current state this overall should make the whole thing more reliable the aerator also is decided locally if it should run based on time of day and water temperature i will attach a video and some pictures below as far as looking into the future i’d like to maybe incorporate a variable run rime that automatically adjust seasonally be it by month outside air temperature or pool water temp this would eliminate any need to change the schedule seasonally making it a truly smart pool controller other ideas i’ve tossed out is smartthings sending a high wind warning to the the photon to run a little extra speed or duration on the floor cleaners i’d still also consider adding chemical sensors if i can find a good reliable and cheap way to do it it would incorporate nicely with my auto injectors as right now ill just have to guess and approximate the time and periodically test the pool img9025jpg750×1334 111 kb img9028jpg750×1334 114 kb img9031jpg750×1334 136 kb edit 09142018 so i have done alot of updates even though i haven’t been in here to keep up on it so i thought i would update the main video at the top of the page as well as talk about a couple of things here particle firmware 070 is riddled with lots of connectivity bugs this made me think i was having network hang issues etc that lead to several coding changes i’ve since found out its bugs in 070 but my changes are still good changes nonetheless for instance i found that if network is lost it causes the loop to hang long enough i was missing some local events so now i have taken control of network control in my firmware if connectivity is lost it will move on and work on regularly scheduled events and checkback every minute or so and try to connect for a few seconds and if it fails it moves on so it doesn’t hang up trying to connect and miss important jobs i added an rssi variable so you can see how your connection is however mainly either run 063 or the new prereleases im on 080 rc10 and its working great in fact particle even incorporated a device health feature and disconnect counter in the new prereleases but do not run 070 the automode now runs as a resume function for instance if you make a manual change and then reengage auto mode it goes back to where it should be locally scheduled the same happens if you have a power outage or the device gets rebooted it resumes the regular scheduled speeds and valve settings instead of waiting for the next event i had the led for the pool light burn out eventually and i got a new one i was surprised it didn’t last longer but oh well the new bulb which was the same kind from amazon has had some changes to how it color cycled so i had to incorporate the changes into my coding i took this time to clean it up and make the color changing code one small function instead of a large function for each color level sensor eventually died to corrosion i need to either get a case printed to protect it from the elements or go a different direction with the design the photon and temp sensor portion are fine since they weren’t directly exposed cheersyeah you have to do some custom coding the particle photon is a blank slate basically you have to tell it what to do i had zero experience with writing arduino code prior to going for these projects but with a little trial and error i was able to learn i think that doing this vs having 10 different smart devices with complex rules in webcore etc is in a way less complicated and way more functional not to mention cheaper to have all control and logic be customizeable by one device just my two centsi’d be more than happy to post the software i have to run the temp level sensor if that helps you as far as the distance definitely do laser i built a version one of this project that had a cheap sonic distance sensor and i started over due to the inaccuracy it wasn’t consistent enough to trust it running my valves the laser sensor i have is this one https://www.adafruit.com/product/3317 the battery is an 18650 hooked up to cheapa lithium charging board also id be more than happy to put together a blurb on the sensor specifically if that helps ya probably tomorrow thoughyeah here’s a quick video of the circuit of just the temp level sensor i think the only question i still haven’t answered of yours is the external antennae you can put one if you want cause the photon has an external ufl connector i do have one on the main pool controller since its in a metal box but on the temp level sensor i don’t i find that with it being in a plastic box it works fine with my house and wifi setup yours could be different of courserx78ntalex the photon goes directly into smartthings yes and it’s a brilliant choice for the project since you can leave it all hooked up and push new firmware to it in the event you want to make changes for the relay board particle makes one and it is kinda expensive and it might have more features but i find it kind of expensive and i’m not sure what extra functionality it even gets so with that said any 5 volt relay would work just with mix voltages you want it to have an octocupller i would have to look at which one i got but i have had several different brands of relays from amazon on different projects with no issues on any of them i think i paid like 810 bucks or so for this 8 channel and yes i do use the outside temp probe for freeze protection although i code that through webcore but you could easily add it direct to the photon code toothe laser sensor i got on adafruit it’s a vl53lox sensor i used ds18b20s for the temperature sensors if you have a huge surplus’s and you figure out how to get the ph stuff going you can always send some my way with instructions of how to get it incorporated that’s definitely the next step this year i want to get ph measurement and colorine measurement and possibly dispensingno the pool pump is always hot it just accepts relay control for speed the idea is so it can be controlled by their expensive pool panels it’s a variable speed pump and it basically has 3 contacts that you can send low voltage to in order to select speed they give you the logic right in the instruction manual so you don’t need their controller i just sent 12 volt dc from three of the relays on the relay board to the contacts on the pump based on which contacts have 12 volts on them the pump knows hat to do and can select 8 speeds including off from the three relaysi’ve added a screenshot of my device handler and how it looks in the phone and my associated action tiles pool control panel as well to the original post i just realized i didn’t add any code to the original post i can put that up somewhere too if anyone needs itrx78ntalex the pump has power draw on it as far as actually getting that value i don’t think i can i just read the value off the screen after it stabilized for all my speed settings and valve positions and programmed that into the photonrx78ntalex a smart outlet wouldn’t work very well cause it’s a 240 volt pump if you wanted actual data you could either buy an aeotec home energy monitor and clip on to the wires at the panel or at the pump i actually have two of these in other things and they work great i got a two pack off buydig.com a couple of weeks ago for 3200 so a total steal or you could even get a hall effect sensor which is how those energy monitors work and get that working on the photon the last option i see is hacking or reverse engineering the communications to the pumps display to get the data from the pump which is above my realm of understanding so i didn’t even try also i didn’t care that i didn’t have real data i figure being or a few watts at anytime was good enough for me i mainly wanted it as a reminder to the effects of increasing the speed as well as possibly roughly tracking the cost however if i did understand how to reverse engineer that stuff that would be the direction that i would want to go for automating my hottub i haven’t forgot about you with that code i will put it up here next time i log in from my computer',\n",

proper pin numbers in the web interface of the device after you add it to the wifi network thanks to cjcharles on the help on the firmware universal firmware for detailed instructions on flashing and setup including video photos see post 360 20170215 update i have added compatibility for a few new controllers that are sold under the arilux brand i’ve posted the specifics further in this post 20170123 update i’ve added the ability to export and import programs scroll down for some program strings that can be copied and pasted into the smartapp 20170121 update i’ve made some changes to the firmware for support for an interesting esp based bulb i am testing the price of wifi bulbs is coming down this one is about 25 and with the qube bulb recently announcing that they are in talks with smartthings i’m not sure how justifiable these are especially if you have to pay as much as i did for shipping to the us nonetheless they work if anyone is interested here is the firmware for the bulb to flash the bulb you simply connect to it’s self created ap go to 192148418080 and upload the file no wires required unlike the controller https://authometion.com/shop/en/home/13-lyt8266.html 20161213 update for very detailed instructions on how to get up and running you might want to refer to this great post by michaelahess 20160825 update released a new additional smartapp to create 5 virtual dimmers and keep them in sync with the smartlife controller r g b w1 w2 now you can easily control up to 5 separate led strips off of a single controller see post 88 i am using child devices now you just need to install the switch child device handler below and choose the different channels you want in the device preferences this is a relatively inexpensive rgbw controller powered by the esp8266 it is a great little device that i have spent some time working on currently using 3 in my home and they have been great this is a really fun device i have created a service manager device handler and firmware for the device for smartthings like i said it is a great device but the software probably needs some bugs ironed out i am working on it with my limited time so hopefully it will get polished eventually but it is extremely reliable as is 1440×2560 152 kb 1440×2560 150 kb 1440×2560 200 kb 1440×2560 149 kb 1440×2560 197 kb 1440×2560 169 kb 1440×2560 204 kb the service manager lets you create programs and virtual switches for the programs this way you can have a program activated based on an event for example you could have the leds flash blue and red if someone opens the front door in the middle of the night the virtual switch will show up as a regular switch in smartthings so there are many possibilities with this first here is the binary for the firmware you flash the device just like most other esp8266 devices there are instructions listed in my sonoff thread to put the device into flash mode jumper the solder points together that are labeled j3 and power the device up second there are three smartthings pieces of code that need to be installed first the device handler for the controller then the device handler for the virtual switch lastly the smartapp they are listed at the bottom of this post after the firmware is flashed the device will broadcast an ssid of esprgbwmac address connect to it with the password configme after you are connected browse to http://192.168.4.1 and connect the device to your wifi network from that point you will open the service manager app and discover new devices it should find the device on your network as long as ssdp is working properly on all of your devices after it is added you can create programs virtual switches and rename them all from in the service manager after flashing the device you can use a momentary switch connected to j3 to physically turn the led strips on and off here is a great video by dalec showing the conversion of a regular switch to a momentary like i said this is a work in progress and i will work on it when i can in its current state it works really well good luck and have fun this is a nifty device program strings these can be imported into the smartapp to enable some cool effects on the strips you of course can also make your own programs and export them share them police lightstrue21red1002100blue1002100 rainbow

sold with a change in hardware that is making the esp8266 not boot with custom firmware the issue is ongoing and has not been resolved yet i’m adding support for these controllers that also run off of an esp8266 the flashing process is similar to the h801 i find that holding the wires in place is rather easy if you have an extra set of hands available to plug things in and press keys on the keyboard so these controllers you connect tx rx and ground to the pins shown below with this all connected and the ftdi connected to your computer then apply 12v power by plugging in the arilux controller after the initial flash you can upgrade any firmware updates via the web interface the firmware is slightly different and can be found here firmware that firmware is tested with the allc02 listed below i will be adding the other two soon they should be up fairly quickly as they just have some pin number differences arilux® allc01 rgb arilux allc02 rgbw arilux allc08 rgbw1w2 4032×3024

someday i don’t think it would be used in most scenarios but i suppose someone could create a special device handler if they wanted to do something like control 5 different single color led strips from a single controller also would be cool if i could use that as an input to be able to hook this up to an external switch to turn on off will have to look into that for sure',\n",

online 20170308 update added support for smartthings health check capability if the device supports it device monitor will look at the onlineoffline status of the device this can be more accurate than looking at events sent by the device 20160906 update added support for ask alexa 20160822 update i have made a few changes i am using a more accurate event detection battery levels can be checked and you can be notified when devices come back online check post 63 for more info this app checks the selected devices to determine if they are communicating with the smartthings hub it checks events from the devices to determine which devices are in a particular state it works best with sensors and devices that are supposed to report to smartthings on an occasional basis it may not work well on devices that are sent commands in routines and smartapps ie lights if the devices send events based on a command rather than on a parse i will look into improving this process as time goes on i used some of the code from quick device check by johnconstantelo thank you also thank you craig for some code inspiration as well you’re the one that got me thinking about this project general options how long in hours before a device is considered inactive check options schedule a check either once a day or at certain intervals 5101530 minutes or 13 hours the smartthings platform will only allow one of these at a time so if you switch from one to another make sure you disable the other one run a check each time one of the devices sends an event this can be resource intensive if you have a lot of devices if you do make sure you set the next option minimum time between checks if you have a lot of devices and the above option is true set this to prevent checks from occurring too often for example if device a sends an event and 2 seconds later device b sends an event you don’t want to run the app each time i find that 15 minutes or more is more than sufficient for the app battery checks check the battery level of devices as well be notified if devices come back online to prevent the app from sending notifications when you don’t want to get them 4am for example make sure to use the restriction options only during a certain time only on certain days of the week only when mode is notification options receive sms or push notifications when devices are offline as well as notifications when they come back online send reminder notifications each day at a certain time send notifications to ask alexa with message queue support expire ask alexa notifications after a certain number of hours have ask alexa reminder notifications overwrite each other so they do not build up over time other options send a notification of your hub goes offline i know that smartthings has this capability built in but it stopped working for some time maybe even still so i added it use online offline status if the device uses the new health check capability the app will use that status to determine if the device is offline this is usually more accurate github.com erocm123smartthingspublicblobmastersmartappserocm123devicemonitorsrcdevicemonitorgroovy device monitor copyright

different schedules and settings fubie i thought it was already configured for github access i don’t have another developer account so i can’t test it but try these settingsinteresting thing happened this weekend first off i have several dozen zwave devices and maybe 10 15 zigbee devices i rarely ever have issues with these devices and for the most part they just work well i had maybe 2 dozen people over this weekend for a gathering maybe 10 of them connected to my wifi access point but the rest i’m sure had smart phones that weren’t connected the following day i got several alerts from this app that my devices had not responded probably about 6 of them had stopped and they were all zigbee based all of them had to be rebooted to start working again zwave devices all continued to work normally i have read several times about the interference between wifi and zigbee wireless bands but had never really seen it in person seems like i was subject to an accidental denial of service wonder how much damage could be done with an intentional one anyway i just thought that was interesting good news is that this app caught the faulty devices and allowed me to correct the issue rather quicklyjustintime i looked into a better way to select or exclude devices but could not find one i also could not find other smartapps that don’t select devices based on capability i don’t know what the battery app is is it just called battery do you happen to have a link to the source codenomisr what platform are you usingon android if you are subscribing to a lot of devices the app will often timeout before it can finish it does not happen on ios so you can try setting it up on ios or try with just a couple devices at first to see if that is the issue let me know how it goes',\n",

       " 'beta complete universal ecobee suite version 1700 has been released as of friday may 17 2019 please see here for the latest information release universal ecobee suite version 17 still free community created device types i am pleased to announce the general availability of my universal ecobee suite version 1700 released today at 400pm edt what makes it universal you ask well to my knowledge this is the first and only ecobee integration that runs on both smartthings and hubitat i’ve managed to create a single code base that delivers near 100 identical capabilities for both hub platforms beginning with this release i’m not going to try to cover all the new features and capabilities here in the community instead i will ask that you visit my github repository and find the what’s new section of the updated readme.md that you’ll find there but just as a teaser release 1700 brings some neat new capabilities including new thermal comfort helper that will actively adjust your setpoints ba highlights single code base supporting both smartthings and hubitat the most significant changes in the latest release include new in 1700k new setecobeesetting name value command allows programmatically changing most but not all documented ecobee settings arguments generally are strings but temperature values can also be a number or a bigdecimal in either f or c based on your locale read only settings cannot be changed and some settings can only be changed using the supplied commands eg use sethumiditysetpointsetpoint instead of setecobeesettinghumidity required for internal consistency use devicecurrentvaluesettingname to get the current value of any setting new in 1700i new notifications engine is now used by all ecobee suite manager and all helpers that employ notifications supports both smartthings hubitat uses the native capabilitynotification on hubitat plus sms remember max 10 sms per day supports spoken notifications via both speechdevices and musicplayers on both platforms new in 1700i working from home helper automatically overrides the thermostat’s scheduled change to the away program if any selected presence sensor is still present new in 1700i thermal comfort helper automatically adjusts heating andor cooling setpoints to maintain thermal comfort google search link based on relative humidity desired pmv activity and clothing type thanks to richard peng for adapting the model for use with the ecobee suite note that you can create multiple thermal comfort helper instances to cover different ecobee programs andor modes universal code dynamically detects and adapts to the host hub platform smartthings and hubitat only no configuration required new in 1700d retry mechanism will rerun command requests that did not complete because the ecobee servers were unavailable note that this code is new and has not been fully tested on both hub platforms numerous bug fixes applies to both platforms new in 1700i significantly reduces ecobee server load for each checkpoll cycle new in 1700i improved error recovery and auth token refresh mechanisms reduces network transactions when not using askalexa uses the authentication code method of connecting to the ecobee api this is far simpler than the pin approach used by the prior port of my code v1414 hubitat thanks to the hubitat staff for assisting me in getting this working as the documented hubitat oauth path doesn’t work for ecobee read the oauth init code to learn the clever trick they helped me employ smartthings this version implements a new ecobee api key for the ecobee suite on smartthings this key will be used for all new installations and it will automatically swap to the new key the next time you reloginauthenticate with ecobee i recommend that all smartthings users reauthenticate after installing this new version over their existing code hubitat caveats does not support askalexa when running on hubitat since hubitat doesn’t yet have push notifications the smart moderoutineprogram helper smartapp doesn’t support routines so it is renamed on hubitat only to smart modeprogram helper hubitat performance since all of this code runs locally on the hubitat hub its performance is different than in the smartthings environment where all the code runs on amazon’s server farms around the world network traffic will typically take longer to your local hub than across the cloud from ecobee’s cloud servers to smartthings’ my observations are that it can take 23x as long to do an update cycle on hubitat than on smartthings depending on the number of thermostats and sensors you have what takes perhaps 3 seconds on smartthings 2 thermostats 10 sensors can take 9 seconds on hubitat that said at the end of the 9 seconds your hubitatbased ecobee thermostat is up to date it takes only 10s of milliseconds to update the attributes in the thermostatsensor devices on smartthings the data still has to be sent to your mobile devices note that all of the interactions between the helper applications and the devices is local on hubitat so there is less network latency and operational delay importantly the code only runs typically 36 seconds per minute this does not appear to have any performance impact on your hubitat hub in any way testing the code if you are prepared to experience minor issues with the code you can install and use this new beta version on either hubitat or smartthings or both following the instructions below i will try to be extremely responsive to problem reports over the next few days please report bugs in this

180 degree range in order to portion the water flow between two different pipes the only thing i’ve been able to find that looks remotely close to what i’m trying to do is these econet valve controls

thosethanks for the responses so far cal7 why not the standard jandy also compatible models from other vendors servo they can be adjusted to have stops at whatever degree of rotation you need mine are controlled by a complete automation system but i don’t see why you couldn’t rig up a 24v relay to do what you want i didn’t know those existedwill have to check into them if they have adjustable stops

any way to remotely adjust the temp on my pool heater i just leave it set to 102 from the panel and remotely turn it on or off it does it’s own cutoff and relight after reaching it’s set temp i’m in phoenix so no worries about ice hereyogijason fantastic post chris i’m trying to do the same automating two 24v pool valve actuators as well as switching pool pump heater i’d like to know how you connected pool heater do you have a dedicated onoff switch for the heater independent of pool pump or you have a secondary switch which operates only when pool pump is on my pool heater has a physical onoff switch that i just leave in the on position it’s a 240v heater just like the pump so i’m using a ge switch to break one of the legs when the switch closes the heater comes on and vice versa this switch is independent of the pool pump so it would be possible for the heater to run when the pool pump is not oni’m doing this from memory on a project i finished a year ago so hopefully this is all right the wiring to the pump and the heater is pretty simple they both run on 240v so i wired each one like the following to break one leg of the 240v circuit i also did some examination of the way the 240v breaker was set up so that i was powering the switch with the hot leg that was paired with the neutral bar for other circuits if that makes sense many won’t recommend this setup because it can give the impression that a circuit is dead with the switch off when in fact one of the legs is always hot this is not a recommended practice but as far as i have found in my googling it’s not against code either the ideal setup would use a double pole switch to disconnect both legs but i don’t think there are any smart switches available like this so this was my next best option you could probably incorporate the smart switch with a dpst relay to achieve the same effect if desired imagepng853×440 53 kb here’s the wiring setup for the valves it requires a separate 120vac spdt relay for

want to verify how your smartapp works will it notify when the temperature goes below 32f or at 32f since the device handler will only report 32f at freezing it may be safer to configure the app at 33fthere is no specific capability for freeze in smartthings so the handle has been adapted to report freezing temperature when the device sends a freeze event freezing temperature or water is 0c or 32f the handler will automatically determine which temperature scale your hub is using and report the value accordingly this number is easier for folks to remember than using the 41f provided by the documentation hence it is being used the idea is to report the freeze event in a way that smartapps can use ityou’re correct when the device preferences are update which includes the name the dth was resetting the temperature and freeze sensor values to mimic a new install patched it up in version 010001 it won’t reset the values if it’s already initialized now you can change your settingsname etc and it will maintain the current state edit btw neat way to use it sounds like you’re using it to check if the freezer thaws out indicating a power failure or potential damage to the stuff in the environmentecolink zwave plus flood and freeze sensor v010001 don’t reset temperature and freeze sensor values when the device settings are updatedthe device doesn’t report temperature so there’s no way to show the actual temp it only reports when it’s freezing or not see first post close like you said but we’ve used other temperature sensors in the freezer with reasonable success like this one with the added advantage of the motion sensor if positioned properly keep in mind it’s not designed for a freezer but in our tests it did work with 910 devices one of them showed a totally incorrect figure release official monoprice motion sensor with temperature tamper and battery device handlerit already does as explained in the first post it reports 2 temperatures based on the device state rboy freeze 0c 32f normal 23c 74f reported in hub temperature scale when it’s freezing it reports 32f otherwise it reports 74f so you can create a simple automation rule to notify you if the temperature is above 32f normal or when it 32f freezing',\n",

       " 'got my aqara double rocker and it’s installed my first impressions are that it is a good device but doesn’t feel as firm and solid as the ge or zooz switches i have especially when pressing buttons that could be because it’s almost all plastic it’s also smaller than my zooz and ge devices buttons are very touchy and not too firm like the other switches where someone who accidentally leans up on one won’t turn it on while it is a white switch it’s matte white and not gloss like my other switches i can live with that it also fits within a traditional decora wall plate instead of using the one that came with it see the image further down the blue led’s come on when the switch is on vs the other way around like all my other switches work i can probably live with that without it driving me too crazy i don’t know if that can be changed or not but i will try to investigate when first trying to join i used the classic app i started add a thing and turned on power to the device nothing happened by just providing power so i tried the usual button presses until long pressing either button and then tapping on either got it to join right away using the zigbee switch power device handler i suspect the other aqara wall switches will perform the same way and use the same st stock dth which is local cool it joined and i can control the light in my lightfan combo but as expected i can’t control the fan because it needs a different dth see below device control from the app is lightning fast and reporting from the device to st is just as fast better than my zooz zen30 both the parent and child switch displays power consumption of the whole switch that means the parent switch or the child switch can be off but still show power usage for the other switch that may be on accumulated energy kwh is reported for the whole device via the main switch overall i’m happy so far but i wish it was a glossy white vs matte white and really wish that the blue led’s would be on when the switch is off this is a zigbee router device in your zigbee mesh but i don’t know how well that works right now it hasn’t gone offline or gone through any rejoins since it was included so that’s a good thing changes may 2 2020 added child switch tile so that both switches are controllable in this dth this only works for the classic app but not in the new app yet the child switch still

now trying to get power values to show up in the child device right now the parent switch reports power for both stay tuned cause this is working and i will post a working dth very very soonif this was only being developed for the classic app building a dth to include the two switch tiles and one power tile would be very easy but the new app throws a kink in that plan since composite devices aren’t supported yet i’m playing around with cluster reporting and endpoints right now to see if the device will report power per endpoint vs the whole device having documentation from aqara on how these things work would be great but that won’t happen edit found the cluster i was looking for yay edit nopethis one is stumping mehere’s a dth for the aqara double rocker switch derived from st’s zigbee multi switch power dth https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsconstantelos/smartthings/master/devicetypes/jsconstantelos/my-aqara-double-rocker-switch.src/my-aqara-double-rocker-switch.groovy this will create a parent switch and then a child switch during device inclusion or when you switch from another dth to this one power reporting works like this both the parent and child switch displays power consumption of the whole switch that means the parent switch or the child switch can be off but still show power usage for the other switch that may be on this dth works in both the new app and classic mobile apps if you get one of these devices feel free to use this dth and let me know if you have any problems with the dthhi prjct92eh2 i didn’t get the single switch but it should work with the standard dth called zigbee switch power since that one also works for the double rocker to control load 1 that stock handler should get picked by doing a generic device discovery in the new app which is technically how i added it via the classic app it will also properly report power the one i modified for the double rocker needed to have the code modified to report power correctly compared to the device it was originally written for i will tweak my dth again today to clean up code a bit so far everything looks and works great no rejoins overnight nothing offline in my zigbee mesh and

the parameters for each weather type and colorcast will let you know if any of those conditions will occur during the forecast period colorcast will also flash the lights if you choose to be notified of weather alerts you can choose the forecast range so you can be notified of the current conditions or if you’re heading out to work in the morning the forecast for the next 8 hours or any number of hours up to the next 24 you’ll know at a glance if you should bring a sweater an umbrella etc you just need a free api key from forecast.io https://developer.forecast.io/ features choose which colors you want to use for each weather event or disable any unwanted weather events specify the cold temperatureactual or apparent the hot temperatureactual or apparent the wind speed the cloud cover the humidity to trigger weather events select the number of hours that you want to look ahead this means you can install a version of the app for workdays that will check the weather for the next 8 hours and let you know if during those 8 hours it is going to be cold hot windy rainy or snowy you can install another instance of the app for the evening that only looks at the next 2 hours you can select to look ahead from 124 hours or just check the current conditions if multiple weather conditions are matched the lamp will cycle through all the applicable weather colors for instance if it’s going to be cold windy and snowing the light will turn on and change from blue to yellow to pink in the event of a weather alert the light will work as it always does but all applicable colors will flash the selection of a motion sensor is optional the app can be controlled by a button click alone select which type of weather alerts you want to see advisory watch andor warning the lights can remember their last settings and revert to those settings after the weather is done displaying you can disable this feature to have the lights turn off when the display is complete the forecast is updated automatically every 15 minutes and stored locally instead of being retrieved each time the lights are triggered to help reduce any delays what’s new 20160221 added support for contact sensors now you can trigger the display when a door is opened added the ability to specify precipitation intensity for rain added the ability to specify accumulation for snow added always on to display the forecast continuously while the app is active redesigned the interface to make it more user friendly and easier to use added option to enabledisable the app added support for lifx bulbs added the option to disable the all clear alert adjusted the color definition for yellow added an under the hood section for additional app settings and debugging always on has some significant limitations that are worth mentioning due to scheduling and app execution time limits when multiple weather conditions exist the lights will cycle through all colors leaving each one on for 2 minutes the scheduling limit is supposed to be one minute which i still think is too long but at 1 minute i noticed a high rate of schedule failures these limitation also prevent flashing the lights for weather alerts trying to flash the lights for more then 20 seconds would exceed the maximum app execution time because of this flashing lights for weather alerts are disabled when always on is being used if an alternative becomes available i will implement it wish list add pollen indicator to the list of available triggers i’ve been looking for a pollen api to do this with no luck so far to install this smartapp go to http://www.smartthings.com/developers/ and create an account after your account is created go to my smartapps then click new smartapp select the from code tab copy the code from https://github.com/jdiben/smart-weather-lamp/blob/master/smart-weather-lamp.groovy and paste it into that page click create click publish then click for me when that’s complete just go to the smartthings app and add a new app swipe the top section over to my apps and tap the app you just created follow the onscreen setup and you’re done let me know if you have any suggestions or comments i’d love to hear your feedbacki’ve added a few new options custom app icon i know i’m super excited abut this one too reconfigured setup pages and added a few options added weather triggers for cloud cover sleet and dew point humidity added option for actual or apparent temperature when checking hot and cold triggers added ability to select which type of weather alerts you want to see advisory watch andor warning you can now choose which colors you want to use for each weather event or disable any unwanted weather events conditionalized the forecast api to only request data that is needed for the enabled weather events this should speed up response time if only slightly i’m still looking for a good api for pollen count and really hope to find one soon the updated code is available at the github link at the top of this pagei’ve added a couple of new features the lights can now remember their last settings and revert to those settings after the weather is done displaying you can disable this feature to have the lights turn off when the display is complete the forecast is now updated automatically every 15 minutes and stored locally instead of being retrieved each time the lights are triggered this should make response time a bit better the updated code is available at the github link at the top of this pageallison so i don’t have any hue lights to test this with i want my lights to work as normal lights and only change colorflash for severe weather can this app do that if so i’m going to buy some hues pronto currently the lights will only flash when there’s a severe weather alert you can’t set a color for a severe weather alert the color is controlled by the weather events you set up for instance if you set the lights to turn purple when there’s rain in the forecast then the lights would turn steady purple for rain with no alerts or flash purple for rain when there is also a severe weather alert i could create a new app based on this one that would do what you’re looking for but i don’t have the time right now maybe in a few monthsrigging65 so if i don’t use a motion sensor is the only way to get the weather report by using the tap trigger yes those are the only 2 options at the moment if you have suggestions for another way to trigger it then post it here i may be able to add it in at some point i am working on an update when time permits that will allow the lights to always report the forecast without the need for any kind of trigger it would update every 15 minutes or so the only downside is that you would lose that light for anything else while the app was running because it would constantly be updating to reflect the weatheri assume your referring to the always on update i’m a bit stuck on this one at the moment smartthings understandably doesn’t seem to like schedules that run more than once per minute if there’s only one type of weather to be displayed this isn’t a problem the problem arises when we need to alternate between colors to show multiple types of weather ideally it would alternate colors every 10 seconds or so in this case i feel that alternating colors every minutes is just too long i’m still looking for a work around and if i find one i will update the app with it i originally had an option to have the all clear disabled but every time i walked past the sensor i couldn’t help wondering if it was really all clear or if the sensor app or smartthings in general failed the issue with alerts could be a couple of things first the forecast.io data compiles it’s own weather data but the alerts i believe come from the national weather service so they might not match up second the weather alerts cover a much larger area while forecast.io covers just your zip code it could be that the high wind alert effected you county but not your town another possibility is that you can set your forecast to show only the next 3 hours but a weather alert will still come through regardless if it is within the time frame you set i thought about trying to parse the alert to see if it falls into the forecast range that’s set but in the end i decided that those alerts could be serious and wanted to make sure that it came through no matter the time rangeaaronsmethurst i didn’t include lifx because i don’t own any of those bulbs to test with if you’re comfortable editing code you can try getting it to work on you’re own if you’re successful you can update the source at github for everyone else to use if you’re not comfortable editing code i can try adding it and give it to you to test let me know aaronsmethurst and mavis the forecast location is based on the location you have set for your hub as long as the hub’s location is set to your zip code you will be getting you’re local forecast

laframboise krlaframboise url to documentation https://community.smartthings.com/t/release-neo-coolcam-power-plug/144274?u=krlaframboise changelog 126 05302019 added fingerprint for new us model and fixed model check 125 02252019 warning because of the paramater number changes mentioned below i had to change the setting names causing all the settings to revert back to their default values added support for new eu model that has different config params all param numbers changed so numbers are determined by the prod in raw description meter reporting threshold changed from 0100 to 00116a so still displaying percentage settings but performing conversion to a for new model before sending to device this file has been truncated show originalwgentine the new plugs are coming with secure inclusion feature on so cannot use this handler any advice that’s messed up they were supposed to send me the latest version of the device i will post a new version tonight that supports security encapsulationwgentine thanks kevin not sure if that helps but this is for the eu version please test the latest version and let me know if it works ok with your devicewgentine however the configuration parameters are not coming through there are always 7 or 8 pending changes and sync or resaving parameters won’t make it i trying to change the led behaviour and had no effect as example this device has a lot of configuration parameters and smartthings often drops some of them when you tap sync it resends all the configuration parameters to the device which may result in the same ones getting dropped when you go into the settings and tap save it only sends the configuration parameters that are out of sync so i recommend attempting to save again if it shows pending changes instead of tapping sync wgentine i decided to exclude and include the device again and got the following error so far unhandled zwaveevent notificationreporteventparameterslength 1 eventparameter 8 zensornetsourcenodeid 0 v1alarmtype 0 reserved61 0 notificationstatus 255 sequence false event 0 notificationtype 8 v1alarmlevel 0 that’s not an error it’s just a notification that i’m not doing anything with i believe notification type 8 means that the device was plugged in krlaframboise another weird thing is energy consumption seems to be working fine until it gets a response like 129382874435 that appears to be an issue with the device and not the handler but i could make a change that ignores the value if it’s negativewgentine saving the changes again or effectively changing something don’t seem to change anything the pending items remains the same and i tried to change the led behaviors turn off but did not work the logging results after tapping save will allow me to identify all the configuration parameters that aren’t syncing it’s possible neo either changed the supported values size or number for those configuration parameters how many pending changes is it showing i won’t be able to get any information from neo until the middle of february because they’re closed for chinese new year so any chance you can post photos of the config section of the manual don’t bother if pending changes is 10 because that means all of them are out of syncwgentine here are the pics taken from the manual either the manual isn’t in english or the writing is way too small to readwgentine this is the logging results after tapping save there are always 7 pending items can you post the raw description based on the values being reported by the device they must have changed configuration parameter numbers because the led setting and remember switch state setting should only support values 03 and yours are currently set to 120 and 300wgentine indeed the device looks just like the same but the raw description is different that’s weird it’s a completely different product and model but the manual matches mine your manual confirms that it shouldn’t be possible to set param 5 to 120 or param 7 to 300 but that’s what they’re currently set to i’m starting to think you might have a defective device that somehow has the wrong firmware what’s the model shown on the box in theory if you try changing each config parameter to 0disabled you may stumble upon one that disables the led but other than that i’m out of ideas i will talk to neo about it but it will be a couple of weeks before they’re backwgentine the box wont say the model but power plug the sticker says yv07a04201 202944102 white eu plug that model number’s not even close to any of the eu or us neo product numbers so if you don’t mind me asking where did you purchase them from',\n",

skill developer website now you simply create them and deploy them directly from your echosistant app if you have 25 rooms you can create and deploy your skills in merely a couple of minutes this update will greatly benefit the new installers of the app it will also greatly benefit current users with room maintenance there are a few other smaller features buried in the apps as well that pertain to control and feedback reliability and overall app performance as usual if you have any questions about the app concerns or request please keep giving me your feedback thousands of hours have been spent on this app and any donations while absolutely not required are greatly appreciated the new skill process is brought to you through the outstanding work of tonesto7 his continued assistance and direct contributions to echosistant have been essential in bringing you the app you know today do not forget that echosistant is now available in the community installer app by tonesto7 beta

simulating and testing even using real devices with real batteries in various states of depletion once others start using code strange stuff happens so far the battery colors seem to work as expected in the simulator and in the ios mobile app i don’t have android so cannot check that unfortunately i’m not yet sure what to make of your 90 in red but i will double check the code and will watch for any similar reports from others wonder if there are bugs in backgroundcolors handling that or i’m not using it correctly regarding battery poll yes that was my thinking too the device will alarm on wet and low battery so you won’t miss critical events if increasing the wake up interval i don’t really need it checking in every hour just to update battery status of course others may feel different which is why i made it user configurable instead of hardcode',\n",

       " 'i have the first pass of an integration ready for wireless sensor tags there is a service manager smartapp that allows you to log into your wireless sensor tags account and reads what tags you have registered you can then choose which tags to connect to smartthings the main support so far is for the wireless motion sensor tags temperature humidity motion and openclose plus more the moisture water sensor should also work but i didn’t have one to test the other types of tags should mostly work as well since their system reports data consistently from the different tag types you can get the code here github stswannysmartthings my smartthings projects contribute to stswannysmartthings development by creating an account on github i’ve tested it quite a bit locally but there may be a few bugs left to iron out i need a couple beta testers to verify here is the link to the tags themselves http://www.wirelesstag.net/ben the tag manager device is required in addition to the tags so it makes one sensor pretty expensive for a number of sensors it becomes pretty interesting though it really looks like the moisture sensor is meant as a plant sensor but i don’t have one to try out sgonsalves the openclose and movement are quite sensitive as they use callbacks from when the tag recognizes motion water should also work the same way but it’s not fully tested currently the other sensors are more passive and would just update periodically there is functionality for a specific temperature and humidity events but i haven’t connected those in the integration i probably can if people want to use them scottinpollock glad someone was able to get it set up right now that motion setting is local to the integration and does not use the wst setting do you see yourself wanting to use them separately for refresh i was currently thinking of it as a refresh from wst rather than a full refresh of the state it shouldn’t be a big deal to do a ping and refresh though i will look into it i wasn’t seeing the two – things you mention are you on android i wonder if they are differences in the app display but i will also check out the code tonight when i have some time swapper on my iphone the app appears under the convenience button on the main page rather than under the sign do you have the convenience option off the main page of the appscottinpollock i am having some refresh problems but not sure where they’re coming from i am seeing some changed temp values in the activity report that aren’t consistent is this polling independent of wst autoupdates it always updates if i ping or autoupdate the tag but not consistent otherwise of course this could just be more polling issues with smartthings right now the polling refresh when executed in smartthings gets the latest value that wst had reported from the tags there are two latency points in the current process time for tags to report to wst and time for my st integration to poll wst you can see in the st logs what is actually getting set in the st device state if the poll or refresh commands don’t happen from st then you could have a really big gap from actual to reality i’m seeing that happen too i may just add some polling to the smartapp if it hasn’t been triggered by st recently for the ‘–’ issue i have seen a similar thing on ios related to state that hasn’t been set i will check out the code and see if i can see any obvious reasons why it may be happening i’m going to try to act on some of this feedback this weekend so keep it coming if you all have more thoughtsswapper try hitting the from the main screen and going to the far right where it says my apps does it show up there if not you may want to go back and try to do the publish step for the smartapp againswapper the myapps section should appear to the right of more in things alerts actions and more it may be worthwhile to email support in this case if killing the app on your phone and restarting it doesn’t allow the app to show up there i can’t see anything you’ve done wrong from the screenshotsinteresting on ios killing the app generally seems to force a refresh for me in these situations greg maybe android is different in that wayi’ve put a new update on github instructions to update your install are located there as well changes per tag motion rearm timer min 60 sec until a bug is fixed in wst backend added smartapp polling of tag status time setting in smartapp device refresh now pings tag and then gets update add special case for pir tag motion detection not tested initialize and refresh water state not just

       " 'i am new to home automation but have several devices successfully set upwith alexa i also have a samsung smartthings hub and samsung smartthings multi sensor on my garage door functioning properly i am using i am using the updated smartthings app i have searched extensively but cannot find a resolution to my issue during the day my garage door is often open which is fine i would like to set up a notification to alert me by turning on a smart light in my bedroom if the garage door opens or if the garage door is open at certain times for example 8 pm till 600 am i do not want the have the bedroom light turned on all day if the garage door is open only to alert me that the door was accidently left open at bedtime or if it opens during the night currently i am able to be alerted if the door opens if the door was closed before the specified times however if the state of the door was already open before the 8 pm the smartlight is not triggered if i close and reopen the door after the set time the smartlight will turn onoff properly the only set up options i see in the app are when the door opens but i am trying to get a notification that the door is open but only during during certain hours any help is appreciatedthanks very much for your response and suggestions i was hoping there was something i missed like a setting somewhere that i could easily change or a simple workaround i will look into webcore i am unfamiliar with it and not very tech savvy but it wouldn’t hurt to learn a thing or two rboy apps may have something too and i will look deeper into it as well but i am trying not to spend more to achieve something that seems fairly should have a easy solutionthanks so much for your detailed instructions following them made creating a virtual switch very easy now my issue is connecting it all and getting the rest of your steps to work in smartthings i can toggle the switch onoff and i can see the state of the switch change in alexa as well in alexa i can toggle the virtual switch onoff and see the state change in smartthings as well all good so far now i think i need create an alexa routine to toggle the virtual switch ‘on’ whenever the garage door is open and off whenever the door is closed then create another routine to only respond to the virtual switch to trigger the smart bulb onoff during certain hours i’ve been banging my head trying to put it all together',\n",

https://github.com/pstuart/smartthings-ps/blob/master/devicetypes/generic_camera.groovy edit preferences after install in devices in ide or on app on phone ip of the camera this is your local ip does

defaults to get username for authentication password for authentication plug in all these values and press the take button and viola locally access camera will return an image i would love your feedback and testing on other cameras how does the physicalgraphdevicehubaction work what i finally put together was that the devicedevicenetworkid has to be the hex ip and hex port for the parse command to work so you will see in the code i take the user input ip and port and convert those to hex and then over write the devicedevicenetworkid to this and that makes the response from the hubaction work then it just parses the response to the s3 image handler just a word of caution the s3 image handler posts the image to the cloud and then streams it back into your phone this means the camera image will work outside of your network but ultimately is saving an image from your camera up in the amazons3 cloud service hope you enjoy it i am providing this as is no warranty and no supportyeah you could write anything to send the image anywhere as a part of a http post if you wanted to in theory but the s3 storage looks like it is coreapi function i have no idea how long the images will stay up but there probably is a path to the image sent to the app if you want to sniff it out feel freei did really quick it appears the images are streaming in via this url https://smartthings-smartsense-camera.s3.amazonaws.com/keyforimage i just tried this outside the app and good news there seems to be some authentication to the storage so can’t access the images

don’t want that on a forum second try my latest code what is the ip and port you are trying to use specifically the port as it appears the port code to hex screwed upi just updated the code the length of the hex port was too long for port under 100 i have to pad 00 to the hex but over that i have to just use the result should be fixed

control it with smart things if so does is make a device for it as well does fire stick be controlled by harmony hub through irda or bluetooth the question means that if harmony hub can control fire stick smartthings’s thing also control fire stick if that yes it is this smartapp create a smartthings virtual device thing and that support to control all devices that connected to harmony hub if added a new device type dth it maybe support almost all command that stored in harmony hub’s device i made a 6 default device type’s dth ex defaultonoff only airconditioner fan robotking tv stb in your case such as fire stick it seems that tv or stb device type proper to you so if somebody want to other device’s type dth i will update that below control flow vritual device thing in smartthings ‘harmonyapi’ server harmonyhub – irda or bluetooth deviceandywak just tried this out briefly very good all works ok so far i had the harmony api server already set up and had done a very basic version of what this smartapp does but kukuharmony does it a lot better if your harmony hub is controlling your devices via itself the ir blasters or bluetooth it won’t control devices via the remote itself commands must go through the hub then this app can access device actions not just the activities what a surprise your quick adapting capability the logitech should support this function officially until logitech support this officially i hope that it is helpful to other people using harmony hub and smartthings i also have a idea that user can add a button and made a custom dth thank you for your reporthello i found that synology supports docker application tt although i tried to run harmonyapi server through synology docker with jonmaddoxharmonyapi docker image it looks like that can not find harmonyhub please let me know how to do that thank youandywak must be set for host network access i think this symptom related to must be set for host network access’ i could not found that menu where can i found that menuhello hm i am sorry that it only can install one hub i will try to support multiple hubrontalley but if you have multiple you choose which one to install yes if there are many harmony hubs in local network user can select one hub to install and usei resolve this problem it related to the synology’s docker version in my old docker appliction there is no option you mentioned after update docker application i can enable that option and also found my hub thank youthank you for your interest through people’s comment i realize that there are many people using

click api information for your region you can then send it to your computer via email from the app enable debugging open live logging in ide and then open the app again and press done and values will be returned in live logging if the above does not work usually as st have introduced a new region then you can just get the app id and token from the last event app id token screen but you will manually need to write this down configure the app online and note down the api token and api endpoint values 2 configure your chosen polling method choices detailed in additional requirements section if you have chosen plex2smartthings exe continue below otherwise follow the guide provided via the link in the additional requirements section then resume at step 4 a download plex2smartthingsexe and configconfig i have also put a zip file containing all of these in the same folder b open the configconfig file c in configsmartthingsendpoints fill in your api token and add the app id to the endpoint urls from the previous section d be sure to also check that your ide url matches the url in configconfig if you have the url from the app then this should be correct if you were unable to get this from the app then you willl need to copy from ide it’ll be somethign like graph-na02-useast1.api.smartthings.com e if plex and this application is not running on the same server then enter the url to the session status page of your plex server in the plexstatusurl attribute f if you have plex pass users with pins and also possibly non plex pass users now be sure to append your plextoken to the end of the url in the step above eg http://localhost:32400/status/sessions?x-plex-token=‘myplextoken’ to find your plex token follow this guide g the polling interval and debugging can also be configured however the standard value should suffice 3 run plex2smartthings you can now run plex2smartthingsexe and the smartapp should be notified whenever any media plays on plex to run this on mono you will need to download mono for mac or for linux install monocomplete the standard runtime doesn’t contain everything you need on linux you can run mono plex2smartthingsexe or mono plex2smartthingsexe to run in the background jobs will show running instances and kill 1 will kill process 1 4 configure the smart app configuration should be self explanatory however come back here with any questions if using plex2smartthings exe you will need to populate player name user or ip if you require device details from then the app has a section called last event which will tell you the details of the last event recieved 5 errors debugging plex2smartthingsexe sendgetrequest the remote server returned and error 403 forbidden there is an issue with the url in configconfig recheck section 2d the remote server returned an error 401 unauthorized you need to get the plex token mentioned in section 2f no error in the exe and no last event present in the app this is because smartthings is not reciving an event this is usually because the app id or token are incorrect if you reinstall the app these values will change and need to be setup again last event in the app but hasn’t triggered the lights to change this is likely to that the room is not configured correctly recheck the name or ip you have setup live logging javalangnullpointerexception cannot get property ‘authorities’ on null object line xx you have not enabled oauth in the parent app go to section 1biii i’ve played a video via plex but no last event is showing if the event is not appearing here then the configconfig is not setup correctly and you will need to revisit step 2 if using plex2smartthings if using the plex webhook then either you have pasted in the url incorrectly or your server is not

this is a smartapp which allows you to view the state of and if your client supports http control control playback volume of your devices some plex clients do not allow control over http such as xbox one ps you need to go into the plex clients settings and enable the http control feature i personally use a raspberry pi with rasplex this distro is fast compact and works with http control i highly recommend it simply knowing the state of your plex devices in smarthings lets other smartapps react to that information good examples are someone is at the door pause playback or plex is playing dim the living room lights eg see rule machine updates 08022016 added support for xbox one viewing status only actions do not work as the xbox onso a quick question on this how is the mode currently set the reason i ask is that i have 1 away mode and 4 home modes based on time however i have a dummy mode that triggers rule machine to evaluate all rules relating to mode also is returning to the previous mode valid always in my instance it wouldn’t be as i could start watching a film in one mode then the mode could change based on time i would also question if mode which should really be used to identify house state rather than a specific room i’m using virtual switches to achieve this but depends on your use case i may take a look at writing a separate app to deal with reverting to previous if it doesn’t already existjust at work at the moment will respond properly later but in short smart lighting is reliant on mode and doesn’t have provision for switches to control if the automation is active or not you could use rule machine which is what i use for everything now but in doing that you lose local processing and if your internet or smartthings servers go down you also lose your lighting automation and depending on how they are controlled you could lose the lighting entirelyso i’ve been thinking about this long and hard and i don’t think there is a workable solution here without moving away from smartlights or at least introducing another smart app that does not run locally so the way mine is setup to work i have the modes away day no auto lights night dimmed lighting and evening normal lighting although this is largely irrelevant as my auto lighting in the living room is controlled by a simple rule in rule machine i then have specified switch to disable rule as a simulated switch the plex app then turns this on when playing and off when stopped the simulated switch is added via my devices in ide add new device i guess it depends on if you are happy moving away from local running if you internet is even slightly flakey i’d advise against it even if it’s not sometimes there can be a delay edit actually you could create a rule machine rule to do this when mode home evening time is before sunset set mode to home day that way the plex app can set to home evening when stopped and rule machine will change it to day form there if it is still day time make sensei’m trying to think of the circumstance that would make sense for lighting if only makes sense to dim to 20 if the light is already on otherwise playing a movie would turn the light on for switches if it’s off then you want to turn it on if it’s on and you turn it on again it’s still on i don’t mind adding something but i can’t see the instance where it actually does somethingahh ok makes sense that’s different to the functionality that is there for the lighting as it needs to record state when it plays and reverts to that state when finished unfortunately it’s not as simple either as multiple switches can exist under these options some maybe on and others off so will need to work out how to store the states of each won’t be able to look tonight as its late here and working away tomorrow so may be a couple of days for me to see if it can work it outbigwebstas child app updated v24 added the ability to return switches to the state before plex started playing not tested it fully but any issues let me knownote just an observation last night i had noticed that my plex token had changed not sure what had caused this perhaps the last update so if yours has stopped working then i’d suggest checking your plex tokenno worries if it’s worth adding then don’t mind adding itsounds like either your app id or token are incorrectly configured open the plexplus app go to api information us and ensure that the 3 instances of id and the one token instance are correct in the configconfig file on your plex server if i have assumed incorrectly and you are actually in the eu then you will also need to update the url as described in configconfig',\n",

even if values haven’t changed logs location mode events supports an influxdb instance on the local lan without needing to route traffic via the cloud support basic http authentication github github codersaursmartthings samsung smartthings smartapps and device handlers contribute to codersaursmartthings development by creating an account on github project thread smartthings data visualisation using influxdb and grafana projects stories hi all here’s a writeup of how i’m using influxdb and grafana to visualise smartthings device states in charts and dashboards the solution uses a custom smartapp i’ve written to send data from smartthings to influxdb crucially it supports the database server being on the same private lan as the smartthings hub so there’s no need to make your database server accessible from the internet i’m quite pleased with it so far in conjunction with my evohome connect smartapp i’m getting some great graphs of my home heating behaviour and energy usage here’s an example of a temperature chart image here’s an evohome heating zone chart with some overlays image i aim to post another article covering some of the moreadvanced grafana features like templating and annotations in th tutorial codersaur.com – 11 apr 16 smartthings data visualisation using influxdb and grafana in this post i present a walkthrough of how to build a server to store smartthings event data and how to visualise that data using charts and dashboardsmichaelahess will there be any impact updating the code with my existing install have to paste in the room id’s to the new version i suppose in terms of changing the code copy over your room ids and check what you are doing with escaping apostrophes functionalitywise you will find it adds some additional tags to each measurement i recommend to update the smartapp settings as there are some new options too eg to log mode eventscolosports i been using this for a few days and works greati’m using a few aeon lab hem v1 is it possible to have it log the watts from line 1 and line 2 separately instead of the total watts i’m sure it is however smartthings doesn’t yet define any standard way of presenting capabilities for multichannel devices therefore the attributes that your aeon lab hem uses to represent the power from each channel clamp will be specific to the particular device handler you are using so if you want to do this you will first need to look at the device handler you are using to find the names of the attributes you want to monitor then you need to edit the influxdb logger smartapp yourself and add some extra attributes for the powermeters devices to do this find this line and add in the extra attributes you want to monitor statedeviceattributes devices powermeters attributes powervoltagecurrentpowerfactor eg statedeviceattributes devices powermeters attributes powervoltagecurrentpowerfactor powerc1 powerc2 hth zalexdw369 is there something different i need to do with the smartapp code when my database isn’t on my local network any help is appreciated it should work as is however you can switch the code in posttoinfluxdb to use httppost instead see the comments in the code this has the advantage that you can see any response come back which should help to troubleshoot i would also check for any firewalls between the hub and your influxdb server plus triplecheck you have the host port and database name correct 90 of the time it’s thati’ve just uploaded v111 this includes support for basic http authentication to the influxdb server use of a callback function to trap errors when posting data and various other minor fixescarpenike fyi looks like the single quotes breaks integration with sonos and submitting tracks that are played if they have single quotes in them unquote this line in escapestringforinfluxdb str strreplaceall replace apostrophes with underscores fyi for some people including me influxdb accepts apostrophes and for others it doesn’t work i haven’t got to the bottom of why this ispatricko do you know if there is a known list of the names to use for the other attributes go into the smartthings ide go to my devices then click on the appropriate device all the attribute names and corresponding values will be listed in the section called current states attribute names are probably casesensitive looks like you have current current1 current2 at leastplease post a link to the dth you’re usingok there are a number of issues with the dth which are causing your problems the custom attributes ie current1current2 power1 power2 are not defined in the metadata section these should be added when events are created they have a zerolength string for the unit this is where they need to be defined eg sendeventname power2 value dispvalue as string unit descriptiontext l2 power formattedvalue watts should include the unit like this sendeventname power2 value dispvalue as string unit w descriptiontext l2 power formattedvalue watts note also the dth does not raise events for voltage1 or voltage2 which is not surprising as voltage meters like this tend to only report one figure anyway all of the clamp channels are assumed to be the

       " 'anybody looking at the new homeseer hswd200 wall switches specifically to create a device handler i have a house full of the hswd100 and they work great but the hswd200 adds the one thing i feel is missing programmable control over the led lights not just for on off but complete control over all 7 individual leds for color and onoff i would love to replace a few 100s with 200s if a new dth provides everything to webcore in their own words in status mode individual leds can be controlled to reflect the status of nearly anything in the home for example if it’s after midnight and the garage door was left open the 3rd led on all the bedroom dimmers can be programmed to glow yellow or any color if a smoke alarm goes off all leds on all dimmers can blink red if no status conditions are active wall switches automatically return to normal mode i used to have this feature with a control4 system but left that in an old home when i sold it example with 2 dogs that go outside first thing in the morning ‘if alarm is armed set leds red’ product page https://shop.homeseer.com/collections/lighting/products/homeseer-hs-wd200-z-wave-plus-scene-capable-rgb-wall-dimmer?utm_source=remarkety&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=200+series+in+stock&_rmid=mrde332zaysb7yoz31lefoxowdrpobfantastic in that linked article they even mention you have to use core to set the status leds awesome now if we can just get this dth approved by st as lighting so it can be run locally your dth and i bet this one will make it be a cloud only device so you have a minor set back here’s what homeseer gets though for this prompt support even after a house full of the 100s ordering several 200s right now yaytheir documentation states setstatusled ledcolorblink your first digit set the lowest led thus we can learn they count from bottom up your second digit is the color 0off 1red 2green 3blue 4magenta 5yellow 6cyan 7white and the third digit is blinktrue detailed but seems surmountable great stuff i just got my first 200 switch but may not have free time until this weekend to really get it installed and start writing pistons excitingconsidering homeseer is a competitor of st i have to say i am impressed with their efforts to support st of course they drive hardware sales this way but still hswd200 part 1 youtubefinally installed the switch and attempted the programing it’s a little funky to find the way to set the values that go inside the parentheses setstatusled111 there is a dropdown parameters near the delete button to set above dougberman said use integers all that worked for me but i accidentally set them all to blink i went back change the third attribute per led to ‘0’ note in the off condition i also used the setswitchmodenormal and the light returns to normal operation however after making the change to not blink only the lowest led would go steady while the top 6 remaining leds continuously blink when triggered nothing i did would change that state i rewrote the piston to only control the 6th led or only led 1 and 2 in all cases the lowest led was solid the rest were blinking anybody fine a reset command of some sorti have not had time to try dougberman’s solution however a few notes to add homeseer youtube part 2 for this device now covering setting the leds is live using core not webcore too bad oh well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99ufc5-fv20 i note he did not use setswitchmodestatus yet it worked i saw notes that if no leds are set the switch automatically falls back to normal statusi wonder if the opposite works ‘if any leds are set then the switch automatically sets to mode status’ that is my guess i emailed homeseer that my switch is stuck they replied today as well they stated the following you cannot send this many parameter changes to a zwave device at once if you are only trying to turn the leds red simple change the color with setdefaultcolor1 and to set it back to white use setdefaultcolor0 that seems a really important note it also left me with a bunch of questions for them which i sent back in email to them my questions with setdefaultcolor1 does that also turn them on i am already using setswitchmodestatus but i am not seeing what will cause the leds to light up note i am not home to test at the moment per your mention of a zwave limit if i had wanted to individually set all 7 leds based on 7 different events let’s assume different colors and blink vs steady state how would i handle this to handle the mentioned zwave limit nor did they offer any way to get the switch unstuck as dougberman has suggested i will continue to post as they reply we’ll get this right and figured outwell they are at least replying quickly re setdefaultcolor q does that turn them on a unfortunately this solution would only work if the lights were on re zwave limit q how to overcome limit a you simply cannot send all of the commands at once if you need them all to change try setting a small delay between the commands i will add something to the documentation to clarify this seems reasonable any zwave specialists out there that can comment on command speed limit 200 miliseconds enough time between commands re switch stuck q how can i get it unstuck a in order to reset the leds use setstatusled n00 where ‘n’ led in question i might pass this one at a time to reset each led then start over i’d rather do this than the reset dougberman offers as resetting the switch pulls it out of all the pistons i think not sure i can test all this tonight but i will get to itgood to know i am hoping 200ms is safe if i have 7 leds to set 500ms each that’s 35 seconds which would be painfully obvious to me and only me but still',\n",

increments due to the smartthings platform unfortunately it looks like the feature i was most excited for automatic search and add devices might not be possible due to smartthings limitations it requires the ability to read the response from a tcp stream which is unsupported at this time let me know if there are any questions comments or feature requestshi david really sorry to hear you’re having issues as well i’ve sent through a pm with some troubleshooting steps if you’re able to help go through them with me it would be greatly appreciated thankshey tylert so sorry about that i’ve been thinking about how to update this to make it clearer but haven’t had much time you need to set an estimated time to openclose in seconds in the settings for each device this allows commands like set blind to 50 to work through homekitgooglealexa unfortunately it isn’t very accurate so i might scrap the functionality entirely let me know if that fixes ithey vbodetti unfortunately the commands you use are controlled by the platform you are integrating with homekit openclose is fully supported and recognises as a blind device type google assistant openclose works 50 of the time onoff is

       " 'i bought my first light switch ezex c2o model i only bought one because i wanted to make sure it works well before replacing all the switches in my house i bought this model because it doesn’t need a neutral wire no neutral wires in my house and because it appeared in the smartthings supported device list i didn’t want to be bothered with any custom device handlers installation and setup was easier than i expected seemed to be working great and no flicker or other weirdness that i read about with noneutral switches but smartthings doesn’t update the status when i use the physical switch for example if i turn on the light using the physical switch it still appears off in smartthings to turn it off using smartthings i need to click the button twice once to turn it on which does nothing because the actual light is already on then a second time to actually turn it off this is annoying and also makes it useless for automation if i set an automation to turn off lights when i’m not home it won’t work because smartthings thinks the light is already off if it was turned on using the physical switch questions is this normal i’m guessing no what can i do about it can i submit a bug report somehow should i be submitting it to smartthings or ezex can anyone recommend good smartthingscompatible switches that don’t require a neutral wire and work with 220v',\n",

18th echosistant evolved was released to the public as the only smartthings app to use flexible cron expressions to schedule recurring events shortly thereafter the notifications addon became one of the most popular features besides making voice interactions with alexa more natural so much so that other developers are now starting to implement cron expressions to improve the reliability of their schedules in the past few months the echosistant team has received several requests to make the scheduling app available to everyone so that even people with no alexa devices can benefit from one of the best scheduling apps on the st platform after careful consideration the echosistant team has decided to reshape the notification addon so that it can serve users with or without alexa devices why forcing users without an alexa device to install a custom skill in order to use the best scheduling app this is a thing of the past as of today you no longer have to you can use the best of echosistant without the hassle of installing an amazon custom skill if you don’t need to send the notifications to an alexa device whether you need to know if someone is at your door or when your next

about this and cannot quite get my head around it if i set a reminder through the 3rd party app to do something on this date at this time then what would you do with that information in remindr and whenbamarayne doing that can eliminate several of my pistons i wouldn’t start eliminating pistons to use remindr actually there are a lot of benefits in using remindr with webcore remindr is a specialized app and the intent of creating it was to complement webcore in a few aspects a faster set up for quick notifications and a few custom safefails to ensure the audible notifications are heard autoadjusting volume to appropriate level unmute the speaker if it was previously muted attempting to eliminate the sonos stutterring and preventing consecutive messages from being truncated these are just a few things that are really not in scope for an app like ady624 s webcore imhodalec would you recommend to not use remindr and go straight to echosistant or get their feet wet using remindr and if they like it move toward echosistant for someone new who doesn’t have echosistant installed i would recommend the latter if heshe would like to push messages to or receive messages from alexa then they would need to install echosistant v5 coming soon',\n",

       " 'last year samsung has announced in all it’s glory that all 2016 tvs will be enabled for smartthings the feature is advertised online and part of their tv specifications on samsung web site yet the feature is still not available even after some products have been launched back in may 2016 over the weekend i bought a samsung ks6510 tv which is on the spec smartthings things support yes and iot client app yes as i already have a smartthing hub at home this swayed my decision to go samsung rather than lg being able to use the lg tv as a wireless connected speaker when the tv is off is a neat feature how do i connect the tv to my hub where is the iot client app i now realise that this is all a massive marketing lie i had a chat with samsung support who blankly confirmed that the tv is smartthing ready but this is not available and he has no idea if this feature will ever be enabled in short he told me that i have bought something which was announced last year a feature i paid for in the price of the tv but i can’t use it as samsung has yet to enable the feature to me this is false advertising pure and simple this is like you pay a premium for a smartphone which support 6g lte when 5g is not even here you still have paid the price for that feature now which you can’t use in this case any product can be future ready on spec why is samsung advertising and selling a feature which is note implemented my question to smartthings samsung staff is simple when i am in the uk not us when would i be able to connect my tv to the smartthings hub receive notification on the tv for motion detection on external camerasensor etc is the use case i am most interested in for the tv control i have an harmony elite lets’ see if we can get some status update on the tv integration with a firm timeline smartthingssamsung slagle alex please clarify the situation thank you br tonythanks david yep i also saw that board mentioning which products are smartthings hub 789 series and smartthings things 6 series i also printed the online spec for the tv from samsung uk site the spec clearly states smartthings things yes and iot client app yes not smartthings things ready and iot client app ready after having a chat with the tv support i then had a chat with the smartthings support going in circle it seems that samsung are pointing fingers internally playing the blame game nop it’s not the tv firmware it’s the smartthings guys nop it’s not the smartthings platform it’s the tv guys who need to update the firmware etc not a good sign when technical teams of the same company are pointing fingers to transfer the blame rather than using their energy to get the feature implemented and released during that time more frustrated and disappointed users like us are losing faith in what was used to be a great technical brand wow evohome was next on my shopping list indeed this is another officially supported product on the smartthings sales website that has not yet been integrated despite the fact that smartthings clearly announced the system support a few years back what is going on is samsung so much in trouble regards tony pson a different thread pm i would be interested to know more about your evohome workaround since it seems that the community has to do all the work to honour smartthings official promises to their userszcapr17 thanks for the good work i will look at thisritchierich thanks i will try tonight but i could see the smart tv listed as a things in the marketplace i have the latest android app installed i will try again tonight and report back tomorrowsbdobrescu so there is hope after all contrary to what the support guys told me on the chat this morning i really hope this will work tonightfightingmajor why another one is needed perhaps because none of the other lengthy discussions have received any recent attention from smartthings staffs and are buried deep into the forum some dates from 2015 etc many of these discussions have turn towards how the users try to work around the fact that samsung and smartthings haven’t delivered on their promises often by developing their own user piece of code as a patch work nobody knows the samsung’s tvs and smartthings technologies better than samsung itself hence we user won’t achieve a refined end product smartapps and integration as good as what samsung demoed and announced last year we want the real thing imo this is not right to advertise market and sale a differentiating feature which is not even implemented lying to customers should not be tolerated the least we can ask to smartthings and samsung is to communicate on this and tell us when will this feature which most of 2016 samsung tv buyers have paid for will be released to us samsung customers this is why i believe bringing this topic once again to the top of the forum is importanti followed the instruction given above for a samsung as a thing and failed i have the latest android app 227 and there are no smart tv listed in the app the only samsung appliances listed are a samsung washing machine and robotic vacuum nothing else no tv so the lie and false advertising is once again confirmed when can we get what we pay for samsung alex slagleyes i am in the uk compare to the screenshot of the samsung product i only have the washer and the robot vaccumm nothing else no fridge no tv no dryer no range oven etc',\n",

       " 'yongfengzhang hi since i see a lot of people being not clear about how the device works i’d like to briefly explain it here the device takes a picture and does the other measurements about every 5 minutes it then uploads the image along with the data to our server it will stop uploading pictures at night but the other data won’t stop updating it’s 24 hrs a day 7 daysweek if you call the api at night the image url will be the last one taken before dark we define ‘night’ as half an hour past sunset we don’t use the luminance sensor to tell it we calculate the sunset and sunrise time with the lat lon utc and dst of the device so the device stops updating pictures half and hour after sunset and restarts it half an hour before sunrise the timelapse video will be generated about 45 minutes after sunset and the luminance sensor is very directionsensitive the hole that lets the light in is small so if you want to use the data in a sensible way you need to adjust the direction to avoid direct sunlight reflections moonlight etc the luminance sensor is located right to the camera or left for this reason we didn’t show the data in the app it’s more a reference remember that the

weather station about a week ago cdmobile mentioned and posted a link to bloomsky’s website and noted that we might be able to get one of these nifty devices for the mere price of shipping many have already noted that they were accepted and i thought that this could be the official thread for them rldreams well i applied to host one as well lets see if i’m approved closest ones to me are all 3050 miles away in each direction they do have an open api for ha integration http://weatherlution.com/bloomsky-api/ chowder007 website shows they have been discontinued need to see if i can get to a hd tonight and pick a few up i assume these will require a special hub if you dont yet have the st hub any idea if they might work with the osram hub cdmobile has anyone heard of the bloomsky weather stations they are having a promo so you can get one for free about 230 if you put one up for 6 months http://community.bloomsky.com/ to keep this relevant they do have an ifttt channel i don’t work for them or anything but i did order one so we’ll see how it goes edit you do have to pay for shipping mine was 20 ups https://community.smartthings.com/t/current-device-deals-best-prices/34950/389

shore house too no problem i can’t always do it but when i have a few minutes i know it bugs people to see the deals thread obliterated by off topic discussions i applied for 2 more for work locations and am going to try to apply for my parents as well we’ll see but it would be cool to see literally what the weather is like at those placestomforti hope a device type can come out of this yeah these two posts below give me hope for a device type i would think that if enough of us st users get these it should come along pretty quickly from the community https://community.smartthings.com/t/current-device-deals-best-prices/34950/389 https://community.smartthings.com/t/current-device-deals-best-prices/34950/393 and as was mentioned earlier bloomsky itself was looking into creating a device type for it d web service or cloud devices developers this is yongfeng from bloomsky http://www.bloomsky.com our company sells an outdoor device that measures the temperature uv index luminance raining and pressure it uploads the data along with a picture of the surroundings taken by a mounted camera to our server every 5 minutes through wifi our users use our smartphone app which uses a bunch of apis to poll the server to get those data our device doesnt have any action or accept any commands it just provides data according to my understanding i wonder whether it belongs to cloud devices or web service smartapps i dont quite get the differences between them if it should be cloud devices i want to know where i should write my service manager and device handler in the developers console do they correspond to my devicescal7 i used the standard order page and the promo code just now to reduce the price to 1999 shipping offer was accepted now waiting on shipping confirmation i would recommend going through the proper channel of application as they can probably rightfully charge you the difference it seems like they are accepting everyone’s applications',\n",

settings based on your thermostat setpoints so that your occupied rooms based on motion detection will get the most heatingcooling during a schedule run the smartapp will adjust the vents only if the main thermostat’s operating state is not ‘idle’ so your hvac is either ‘heating’ or ‘cooling’ or the fan is running if you want to control your smart vents with this smartapp the following safeguards have been implemented it checks each vent’s temperature and makes sure that it’s within the minimum and maximum range to provide safe operation it checks the ratio of closed ventstotal connected vents and will ensure that the ratio is not higher than 50 it ensures that there is a minimum open level for any vents inside the zones scheduled at a given time the smartapp was initially designed for ecobee thermostats but it can now handle any thermostat connected to st you just need to ignore climate settings and define your coolingheating setpoints edit some configuration use cases are

1080×1920 396 kb 1080×1920 400 kbnatekeenhome sure i’d be interested in knowing more what about a partnership pm mehello jonathanmcguire the smartapp is actually using a logic similar to ecobee3 with its remote sensors ie the temp at the main thermostat is adjusted according to the avg temp calculated from temp sensors data in each room but it applies this logic inside the zones that you define as part of your own schedule setup the smartapp then activates the vents to create the zones by turning on the vents inside the zoned rooms in order to attain the desired temp settings coolingheating setpoints so in your second use case if your 3 rooms are part of the same zone for example for the night schedule let’s say that these rooms are your upstairs bedrooms it will calculate the avg temp which is 72 based on the rooms data that you provided and make a temp adjustment based on ecobee’s current temperature in order to compensate for the temp differential between the bedrooms and ecobee the smartapp will then activate the vents inside the zone to turn them on open for your night’s schedule and turn off close all the other vents in your house 1st level and basement in your 1st use case if the rooms are rarely occupied then their temp’s sensor data will be excluded from the avg temp calculation as they will likely not be occupied at the time when my smartapp does the avg temp calculation their vents will stay open if they are part of the zone if you don’t want them in the zones associated to your schedule ex night then their vents will be closed my smartapp will command the ecobee thermostat or any other thermostats to reach a desired setpoint for the zones that you selected in your schedule not a range of values this is the smartapp’s behavior now your ideas are food for thoughts on future smartapp improvementsdevelopments regardshello jonathan mcguire good news i was able to integrate the logic for use case no 2 actually what i’m doing is the following a calculate the avg temp based on any given zone’s rooms where there are temp sensors with the occupied or not option b calculate the avg temp diff between the avg temp in the zone and the desired temp c for each room calculate the temp diff between the room temp sensor and the desired temp d adjust the vent set level in based on tempdiffatsensor zoneavgtempdiff the setlevel will then be more precise than just open close or half close fyi please note that the vent settings are adjusted every 5 minutes within a given schedule as i don’t have my keen home vents yet i was able to test it with my light dimmers and the logic seems to be working fine as for the 1st use case i’m not sure at the moment if it’s really safe to potentially close all vents inside a given zone i need to do some testing beforehand as closing too many vents can damage your hvac also based on the logic that i described for the 2nd use case i think that most of the 1st use case is covered regardsjonathanmcguire ok i think that i found the issue here please grab the my ecobee device at github latest code and test it on your end as there is no way for me to check if it really works or not let me knowhello jonathanmcguire you probably need to kill the smartthings app and reload it to view the results at least on android if you have upgraded to android v117 i would recommend to also clean your cache before restarting the smartthings app bye for nowhello today i added new features to deliver an even smarter app ability to set your smart thermostat ex ecobee nest to away or present based on all rooms’ motion sensors ability to set fanmode ‘on’ ‘auto’ ‘circulate’ during a specific schedule added some new input parameters in schedule page to adjust main thermostat’s settings based on outdoor

there are a lot of st scheduling issues due to the progressive introduction of a new scheduler for st users to make sure that your smartapp has been scheduled properly please do the following a click on https://graph.api.smartthings.com/location/list and then click on smartapps at the right for your location b scroll down to scheduletstatzones and click on it you should see something like this c under scheduled jobs if you don’t see the smartapp being rescheduled within the next 5 minutes then it means that the st platform didn’t reschedule your job properly if your smartapp is not rescheduled by the st scheduler a on your device you then need to go to my apps under the main dashboard b click on the scheduletstatzones smartapp c press the next button at the right top corner several times till done to reschedule the smartapp d check that the smartapp has been rescheduled properly by doing step 2 again regards',\n",

i had lying around i recommend using something with more strength if you do this the weird cutout in the 2x4 is to compensate for the weird hump on the back of the galaxy view 20161221 222859jpg4160×2340 251 mb i ran power through the wall with a 142 power cable and then made up the ends like an extension cord the other end of which runs into my utility closet and plugs into a plug in there allowing me to easily unplug this device if needed i tried smarttiles but much preferred to just use sharptools and then create custom widgets to trigger routinesactions for the interface i used total launcher which basically is a freeform launcher allowing you to make whatever interface you want 20170102 135549jpg5312×2988 222 mb we mainly use the tablet for viewing our family calendar accessing our shopping list todoist added from google home viewing recipes pepperplate controlling smartthings and viewing our outdoor security cameras tinycam i also use blue iris which plays a doorbell chime on the tablet when someone approaches the door i built a frame out of some old trim i had and attached it using magnets so i can easily pull it off to press the power button when needed one thing we love about the tablet is the ability to have it display our family pictures when not in use like a screensaver using google daydream let me know if you have any questions 20170102 135555jpg5312×2988 194 mb 20161224 072401jpg4249×2390 162 mbso i would have gone with a poe to usb adapter which i’ve used in the past but this tablet doesn’t use a traditional micro usb power plug unfortunately and i couldn’t find one that went to usb that is the reason i did it with an extension cord end on each side though so i can unplug it should i ever decide to stop using it and the power cable will essentially be dead so no risksure that’d be awesomewe use ours a lot mainly for recipes using pepperplate and to view our security cameras using tinycam i have an ip camera mounted above our front door which triggers a doorbell sound to play on the tablet anytime somebody approaches the door using blue iris we do occasionally use it for starting a song on spotify and having it play on one of our chromecast audios but we usually just do that through our google home if you don’t have the google home i would definitely enable always listening okaygoogle functionality on the tablet and you could do some really cool things with that if all you’re wanting it for is controlling smartthings and listening to music i’d actually consider the google home instead the tablet excels for things where you need a screen or i guess you could have the best of both worlds and take a look at the tcl xess with builtin alexa as for the layout i started with this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.launcher2.theme.flattered and then had my wife chose a color scheme she liked on google and just made new squares of the appropriate wifeapproved colors and then looked up png icons to go over them it’s all pretty easy with the very customizeable total launcher now that i’m more familiar with the launcher i could have easily built it without buying the theme but it was a good starting point for a beginnerupdate to this project i have the power end of this tablet plugged into a zwave applicance module that turns off at nightaway mode so the screen doesn’t stay on all the time the screen is set to stay on when plugged in so when the power turns off it turns off the screen when the power comes back on in the morning it turns the screen back on and resumes the screensavergood question just because i wanted it to turn off when we put our house into night mode right away instead of using tasker to have it happen at a certain hour that being said i realize that i could probably actually integrate tasker with smartthings but i had an extra zwave switch and it was just easier haha so i guess the answer to your question is laziness also my plug isn’t really to code so i like the idea of completely cutting power to it while we are asleep or awayyep the mountstand thing on the back comes off extremely easily you basically just push on a certain spot and it pops off instructions on youtube i actually have a galaxy tab 122 in my bedroom as well but not wall mounted and it’s also a great tablet but the 18 view is an absolute pleasure in the wall we actually bought the 122 to wallmount at first but decided it was too small and just ended up using it on our bedroom nightstand instead it’s also our watch movies in the minivan tablet for trips with the kids',\n",

       " 'after being unable to find a way to control my sleepiq enabled sleep number bed i took the time to create an app that works this is my first app on smart things so if there’s something i can do to improve it let me know i’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and it’s been great features create separate devices for each side of the bed raise bed to favorite position on either side lower bed to flat on either side set sleep number on either side presence sensor based on if you’re in the bed doesn’t update unless you use one of the other controls i wouldn’t rely on it but it was possible so i enabled it wasn’t worth a post update since i don’t really plan on using it i have a joined king with an adjustable base this is the only configuration i was able to physically test the manager on so if you run into any issues with any other configuration let me know so i can sort it out for everyone you must have a sleepiq account and enabled bed for this to work it doesn’t work over bluetooth if you have an adjustable base use these adjustable base smart app adjustable base device handler if you don’t have an adjustable base use these no adjustable base smart app no adjustable base device handler the only difference between the two is the one without the adjustable base removes the functionality of turning the bed on or off to raiselower the bed it also will display the sleep number on the my home tab rather than whether the bed is raised or flat to set it up just enable the smart app and log in with your sleepiq account then you’ll be able to create a device for each side of your bed it should support if you have more than one bed on the account as well if you’ve never enabled a custom app before user jdroberts made an amazing tutorialoverview faq an overview of using custom code in smartthings smartthings classic faq so you’re new to smartthings you asked a question and someone suggested custom code as an answer or you were browsing the forums and you found something that sounded like it would be perfect for what you wanted but again uses custom code what does that mean how hard is it to do and what’s the difference between a smartapp and a device type handler note the official terminology has changed a couple of times device type handler device handler dth and device type all mean the same thing and you will find all these terms used in the forums section i smartapps and device handlers what they are smartapps tiny programs to decide what a specific device should do when or to collect the information from a specific device smartapps including the various f once you have it set up you can name the devices whatever you like i named my side tim’s bed to make controlling through alexa easy the bed kind of works like a dimmable light bulb on raised to favorite position off flat dim level sleep number 0100 this way you can say set x bed to 50 via alexa and she’ll change the sleep number i also set up a routine for when i say raise the bed it turns the bed on and if i say lower the bed it turns it off this works very well i also have a routine that turns the bed on in the morning when it’s time to wake up if you have a joined bed like me you only need to turn one side of the bed on and the other one will automatically update if they’re separate you can control them individually if there are any other features you’d like to see let me know and i will see if i can implement them also it’s totally unnecessary but if you found this useful and want to support feel free to donatellcanada sorry about that i changed the naming before i uploaded it to github so it couldn’t find the device reinstall the app and device handler and it will work nowscottpurkey yes it should work fine for you turning the bed on or off will simply do nothing for you so you can just ignore those settings but can still set the dimmer to whatever you want the sleep number to be for that side of the bedi’m not sure what you mean by privacy mode is this something that’s part of smartthings or amazon echo as for the google home i don’t have one to test but it should be able to control the switch via smartthings just like alexa can i haven’t used it to know how their routines work but turning the bed on or off like any old switch should work fineedit i have now split app and device manager in two depending on whether you have an adjustable base or not please use the correct links above and you won’t have any issues thank you for narrowing this down i was unable to test it without a bed that doesn’t include a flexible base what you did will make the button state always be on which doesn’t matter if you don’t have a flexible base i went ahead and changed the line to iffoundationstatusfscurrentpositionpresetright null devicecurrentside right foundationstatusfscurrentpositionpresetright flat devicecurrentside left foundationstatusfscurrentpositionpresetleft flat which should keep the functionality of adjusting the base but not give you the error if you don’t have a flex base this will default the switch to off if you don’t have the base so now no one has to make a change whether you have the flexible base or not thanks againi don’t have a split bed so i can’t really test this so let me make sure i know what you mean if the bed is flat and you turn on the right side both the sides go up wrong if the bed is flat and you turn on the left side only the left side goes up if both sides are up and you turn off the right side only the right side goes down if both sides are up and you turn off the left side only the left side goes down i don’t see this happening in the logs for my bed but again it’s hard to tell since mine isn’t split also i’d love to have it work as a dimmer for the feethead position that was my original goal when i started working on this but the bed doesn’t work that way for the position of it unfortunately at least by what i have access to via the api i can only set it to a few set positions flat favourite snore zerog even if i could i’m not sure how it’d work having two sets of dimmer switches for one device i don’t know if smart things could do that so i’d have to split up the sleep number head position and foot position into 3 seperate devices',\n",

out the omnithing websitehttp://omnithing.net it is home to a configuration tool that makes setting up omnithing much easier state of the project omnithing is currently in alpha please keep in mind that at the time of writing this it has only been used by one person so any bug reports are appreciated contributions to the project are encouraged a guide to contributing can be found toward the bottom of this readme people trying out omnithing coming from stanything may note that fewer arduino devices are supported this is due to memory restraints omnithing uses much more ram than stanything due to it using a json configuration due to this omnithing is not a total replacement of stanything functionality so people using arduino unos and megas wont have much luck with omnithing mega support could potentially come in the future but uno has no chance additionally omnithing is still in early development so it may be less stable than stanything in addition to missing some of the stanything device types at this time finally unlike stanything omnithing does not require the end user to edit actual source code instead of adding stuff to an arduino sketch everything is done through the omnithing json configuration file omnithing parses this file and dynamically creates the desired devices at startup this file has been truncated show originalversion history alpha 082 add optional

make further changes to them if you are using omnithing on an esp32 or esp8266 you can even download a complete sketch which includes your configuration already you just download the zip file extract it and open up the sketch in the arduino ide you never even have to touch source code to get it runningthanks for the heads up the site should be back up nowi have just released omnithing version 040 this release is focused on making omnithing convenient to use on raspberry pis you can now install and update omnithing using raspbian’s native package manager additionally the omnithing web

buildi don’t have a mac to test this on myself but i believe following the linux buildinstallation instructions may work with little to no code modification i can’t think of anywhere where i’m using linux specific code that wouldn’t work on other unixbased systems one thing that i know wouldn’t work is the systemd service files since macos uses launchd as opposed to systemd so omnithing and its configuration tool would have to be started manually or a launchd configuration created for it to try this you’ll want to make sure you have nodejs and cmake installed on your system the linux build instructions are in the github readmei believe this is possible on a raspberry pi but it will require creating a virtual network interface basically you can create a virtual interface that you can give any fake mac address you want then you can have it use the actual ethernet interface behind the scenes i would have to add support to the networksender and networkreceiver to allow specifying which interface to use but i don’t think that should be too difficult i can take a closer look at it tonight',\n",

are available on the rboy apps server © rboy appsthis is just a generic smart app designed to work wtih any thermostat so it only programs the current temperature and sets up timers on the st platform to change the thermostat temperature at the user entered times so yes it runs on the st platform and no it doesn’t disable any other programs or schedules so you have setup so you will need to take of any conflicts eg i have set this program to use when in home and night mode only and ensured nothing else is changing the temperature on the thermostat in those modesjust fixed a bug when crossing over midnight causing the scheduler to skip a day at timeswiredly there’s a bug in the platform after schedule the apps needs to call unschedule before scheduling the next schedule or it stops working after 23 schedulesno just take the latest code i just updated it maybe you got some old code it’s working because i’m running it right now you don’t need to change anything i have other temperature apps also connected and no issues at all i think it just may be a bug if you can in your ide open the live debugger and if you get the error let me know what line it shows up incan you help me with data you’ve entered also did you enter the external temperature did you enter all temperatures for weekday and weekend when you open the ide to the left of the documentation link is a link called live logging the url is https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/logs i think you may need to enable it once in your settings am not sure but once in the live logging then update the app and all the debug messages should show up there with the error and location i’m current using this on 2 thermostats but i’m not using the external temperature optionand yes it was updated multiple times today i just updated it about 15 minutes ago try taking the latest code right now if you haven’tit looks like your time input was wrong or your system isn’t setup right it isn’t able to get the date from your system try this delete the app all together from your list of my smart apps then create a new apps and copy the paste the code and start over it may be an installation issue someone from the st team told me that the date used by st is when the app was first installed possibly in this case it didn’t register a date due to some bug try clean overjpuser 20141113tnull check your input specifially see this line 20141113tnull usualy it’s a datettime in your case the time is null so it’s not taking the inputs properly possible time2 leave timebe glad to be of help i just put a new app to change the thermostat based on motion in the room this is good feedback let me see if i can make it mandatory to include all timesdone i know st’s slow i understand they need to focus on the platform and it’s performance and stability and if they can do just that i’d be okay i don’t mind making apps for the community i just wish that st had a better support on the community forum there are just a few folks who seems to be from st and i don’t hear from them much get much support on issues to help us get these apps out of the doorsfixed an issue with external temp sensor now added independent cooling and heating switching temperatures for external temp sensor to avoid oscillationadded support to detect mode changes so that the latest temp is reset when an active mode is set eg returning from away to home and thermostat is only set to run while in home mode it will reset the temp to the current scheduled temp when the mode changes to home',\n",

       " 'do you want a smart sprinkler controller that is integrated with smartthings but won’t break the bank are you looking for a diy smart sprinkler that doesn’t require an arduino and smartthings shield if so this may be what you’re looking for i’ve created an esp8266 based smart sprinkler based on the smart sprinkler project written by stan dotson and matthew nichols rather than using an arduino with a smartthings shield the esp8266 is wifi capable and communicates directly to your smartthings hub over the local lan the entire project is on github and consists of two smartapps two device types and the firmware source and binaries for the esp8266 microprocessor additional details and high level instructions are in the readme project highlights include a smartapp that discovers smart sprinkler controllers on your network using ssdp smartthings scheduler to run your sprinklers based on day of the week time and even current weather overtheair ota updates of controller firmware directly control your sprinklers from your phone or even amazon echo option to directly control a manual relay or pump esp8266 hardware options there are a large variety of esp8266 based options including prefabricated boards with relays that can be used for sprinkler controllers i’m using the linknode r4 and linknode r8 they can both be found on amazon for around 15usd they even have files available for 3d printing enclosures note i am not a professional developer and haven’t coded in many years the code i’ve come up with is a result of a lot of copypaste and trial and error it’s not pretty but it’s been keeping my lawn green for a couple weeks now feel free to try out the project and send me your questions comments and suggestionscsc links should be fixed now i’m not sure i understand your question about which sprinkler is being used this controller should work with any standard 24v sprinkler valve if wired properlythis project is typically used for underground sprinkling often these systems are professionally installed but you can diy also most of the parts are available at stores like lowes or home depot in the usa the part that is actually actuated by the smart sprinkler controller is the valve example these valves are usually connected by some sort of hose or pipe to your water supply and then connected to an inground sprinklerthe sprinkler system has been very stable since i set it up a month ago the one exception is the weather integration it seems that the smartthings getweatherfeature call doesn’t always work still more debugging on that there are quite a few safety features built into the setup to prevent leaving a sprinkler zone turned on or turning multiple on at the same time smartthings will tell the sprinkler controller which zones to turn on and for how long however the timing for running the zone is done on the controller itself that way if the hub loses connectivity to the internet or the sprinkler controller the sprinklers don’t just stay running in the event of a power failure or a reboot of the controller during sprinkling the relays will automatically reset to their normally open state thus closing the sprinkler valve one other really important note on using the linknode r8 you must flash the firmware the first time using dio instead of qio unfortunately the r8 documentation is incorrect if you flash using qio any io call to the 8th relay will cause a rebootkakektypo sorry i missed your question while i was taking some vacation were you able to get the linknode to work if you can detect the linknode and add it as a device i would expect it to work if it is still not working i can walk you through some additional troubleshooting stepsi have not added the functionality to create individual virtual switches that apply to the individual relays it wouldn’t be too hard to add though i’ve thought about doing it so i could control individual sprinkler zones using alexa for my pool pump i’m using a gocontrol fs20z1 the relays on the linknode aren’t rated high enough to control my pool pump directly however i did create a custom device handler and smartapp based on the irrigation controller that allow me to schedule the pump but also give me the overrides to run the pump continuously skip a schedule etc i haven’t published those yet let me know if you’re interestedi still see the issues occasionally i don’t think the issue is with my smartapp though the issue is with the smartthings getweatherfeature function it uses an api to weather underground and weather underground limits the number of api calls that can be made in a period of time without a subscription occasionally the getweatherfeature errors out saying it has exceeded the connection limit i’ve worked around it most of the time by setting my timers to start at odd times like 1007 rather than 1000 there seems to be a lot more people calling the getweatherfeature on the hour',\n",

although it does report what brightness level the lights are at the old app also does dimming in the bottom right corner of the big marquee there’s a percentage bar tap that and it will let you dim kevindonde when i got this to work i referenced your repository straight from github in regard to working with all of this smart things i wonder if that is good practice or if a better practice would’ve been to fork your repository and then pull from my own copy of the repository that way i’m not reliant on your repository or forced to receive changes you make i’m really asking as i’m still very new to the platform and groovy i’m not sure to be honest i usually use the original repository unless i plan to make changesrpwong hi all i’m also completely new to smartthings and i’m having the same issue of the dimmer not showing up in the old app kevin how did you add it in the new app i don’t see an option for adding the wemo dimmer when i go to add new devices honestly i wonder if it’s the wemo dimmersi haven’t found them to be the most stable pieces of hardware thanks for your work on this sirtwist and everyone else edit success i had originally just copied and pasted the code i instead enabled github integration and updated from sirtwist’s master after doing that i was able to find my dimmer in the old app i don’t know why it made a difference i’m certain i copied every line but it did that’s really weird not sure why that would happen but i’m glad you got it workingandyserwatuk i’ve got thinks up and running it finds the wemo dimmers and i’m able to control them i even set up some smart lighting mirroring between 2 dinners it works great for about 3 days at most at some point one or both for the dimmers will no longer talk to smart things i can’t turn it on or off from the wemo app the light is working fine and it’s in the wifi it’s just smarthtings that has the problem i generally have to futz around removing and reading the lights the devices and the smart app itself u til it works again and then it works for up to 3 days i’m happy to help try and troubleshoot just let me know what you need i wonder if maybe your switches are getting new ip addresses when their dhcp lease expires if your switches are working now and you can find the ip addresses of them maybe make note of them and see if they’ve changed when they stop working next the other thing you can do is go into https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ and go to my smartapps find the wemo wifi smart dimmer app and click the edit properties button on the edit screen open up the settings pane set the debug setting to true and click the update button imagepng1119×936 367 kb this will enable debug logging which will give us a lot more information to look at when the dimmers stop workingethos i copy and pasted your device handler and smart app code you into my account when i get to the discovery part in the smart app it never discovers anything i have 3 wemo dimmers i apologise but i’m 100 brand new to all of this stuff i must have installed it wrong or something how do i install from your repo as opposed to copy and pasting your code in i must be missing a step somewhere you should use github integration rather than copypasting i’ve seen posts both in this thread and elsewhere of people having problems with smartapps and device handlers when they copypasted them in instructions for

       " 'sometimes all you need is a button push whether it’s to eject a dvd open a microwave door start a dumb air purifier or start an otherwise really smart television there are some devices that require a button push there are even some smart devices like the aforementioned televisions which are really smart once they’re turned on but don’t have a good way to turn them on for those of us who really need or really want this the solution is simple a tiny actuator like a robot finger rip microbot push as mentioned elsewhere sadly i can no longer recommend the naran microbot push as the company seems to be going through a lot of problems and they have now dropped their ifttt channel all together the push was a beautifully engineered little device with a lot of extra features but i think just too complex to set up and operate for a mass market whether here or in asia i got my own money’s worth out of them since it’s now three years since i bought mine but i am still sad to see them go 2019 the mildly improved switchbot the best replacement on the market now is the new generation japanese switchbot this is made to be cheap and pretty cheaply made no real features to speak of except a button push or a button hold it has less force strength than the microbot the switchbot is rated at 1 kg but i have found it to be closer to 08 they have redesigned it so now instead of telling you to use a sticker and a bit of fishing line they give you a nicer looking sticker with a loop and there is a little slot in the switchbot finger so it’s easy to attach this is still a clunky little device about 3 inches square and you may have to get creative with sugru to get it to fit where you want it to be but it does do what it supposed to push a button i think the best use case is for smart tvs which are really smart once they’re turned on but don’t have a good way to turn on except an ir device like harmony hub stick a switchbot on the back where the on button is and you solve that problem it’s ok for some of the other things that i use it for like operating a blender button it is not strong enough for example to flush a toilet even a button operated one it’s not even strong enough to open some microwave doors also unlike the microbot this will not work on capacitive touchscreens it’s only good for pressing a button that requires a physical press an ir bonus with the second generation switchbot hub plus on the other hand speaking of ir the hub that you need to get for it which will allow you to integrate it with google assistant echo ifttt or the new v3 smartthings app now has its own ir blaster which can be useful for some things like some window air conditioners or other devices that have an ir remote so that’s a plus if you happen to need that the price on the hub has also come down since it was first introduced although cheap for this device class still doesn’t mean really cheap typically the buttons sell for 29 each and the bridge sells for 49 it occasionally goes on sale for about 20 off or sometimes in a kit from their own website switchbot switchbot your simple switch to a smart home alexa google home switchbot mechanically controls a rocker switch or button control with an app alexa google assistant ifttt or more verdict a solid b i’m not unhappy with this device i just don’t love it the way i did the microbot but it does solve a use case that can be hard to solve otherwise in my house two use cases the blender and the eject button on the dvd player which can’t easily be solved any other way without voiding the appliance warranty this one requires no wiring no soldering no damage to the dumb device you’re just adding a tiny actuator to push the button i give it a solid b especially if you get it on sale the following video review is great and really shows you what it looks like around the house would it work for you also if you’re not sure how much force the buttons around your house would require see the following faq how to determine force required to push a door or button or lever howto if you start automating things around the house to assist with accessibility one of the specifications you have to look at upfront is the amount of force usually given in pounds required to move the object for example ada requirements are that a regular door be able to be opened with 5 pounds of force or less a typical toilet lever in the us usually takes about 4 pounds of force while the toilets that have a button on top typically only require about 2 pounds of force most buttons requireless than 1 pound of force but some of the ones that are attached to a mechanical relay including microwave door buttons may require two or even 2 12 pounds and sliding doors have a huge variance some take only 5 to 8 pounds of force while others like heavy wooden barn doors may take asi am using just the switchbot hub not the button pusher to turn on my otherwise smart tv my tv is one of those models were once it’s turned on you can use voice control with it but there’s no way to turn it on except by ir or physical button press under 50 simple no coding solution to power on most brands of smart tvs switchbot connected things woo hoo i got a cheap 32 fire tv at black friday it doesn’t have as many voice commands as the fire tv cube but i just wanted an additional tv for our guestroom the tv is fine the voice commands work fine but there’s no way to turn it on or off just by voice or turn it onoff with an automation so it’s a lot like the very expensive samsung smart televisions that way i knew it could be done by adding a harmony but i didn’t want to spend that much money and it seems like overkill since once the tv was on i was going to do everything by voice with the fire tv options i just needed a way to turn it on by voice as it happened i already had a switchbot hub plus which is used to control robot finger actuators in other parts of the house so i was thinking about just gettingcharly5star hi is there anyway to use the switchbot just with the logitech harmony hub i dont want to buy the switchbot hub as i already have the harmony hub i just want to be able to buy 1 switchbot and connect it with my harmony to be able use to it with alexa on the internet thanks unfortunately no you have to use their hub and their app i don’t know of any comparable device that would work just with harmonycharly5star i have seen there are 2 hub the switchbot hub plus and the switchbot hub mini can i use any of them to use the switchbot with alexa or does it have to be the plus version thanks you can use either of those two the hub plus also acts as a nightlight but the home automation features are the sameyou need the switchbot hub for any switchbot third party integration including ifttt or smartthings it can be either the cloud shaped hub or the mini hub as prjct92eh2 said you don’t need a smartthings hub because this is a cloud to cloud integration but the switchbots themselves need their own hub in order to reach their own cloud',\n",

all and they seem to sync up well however i have the latest firmware for my wifi modules available brp072a42 and that is v290 so something tells me that there is either regional differences or

know and we can do our best to troubleshoot and figure them out artispagsanjan note the behaviour you are describing with the google home is a limitation of the smartthings thermostat capability you have to phrase it with a mode ie hey google set the bedroom thermostat to coolheatauto i have added switch capabilities which may enable the behaviour you are describing but i have not had a chance to test it with the google home yet see this link for more info https://support.smartthings.com/hc/en-us/articles/214609826-google-assistant-smartthings-faq#thermostats note that only the generic

       " 'i’ve created this new topic for discussions of the xiaomi aqara wall switch qbkg03lm with no neutral wire in particular my aonghusmor dhthere are several different ways to do this if you are using a smart bulb then it’s always possible to use more than one unwired switch to toggle not switch on or off the bulb with a dumb bulb and one wired and one unwired switch let the unwired switch soft toggle the wired one with devices such as those from fibaro or aeotec which are not switches as such but fit behind a conventional switch to make it smart it’s possible to wire it up to use the existing 2 way switch wiring the first 2 of these use an app such as smart ligting or abc manager advanced button control to link the unwired switch to the bulb or to the wired switch in such cases it’s generally better to use ‘toggle’ rather than ‘onoff’ as otherwise it’s all too easy for the state of the switch to get out of sync with the state of the bulb or the other switch hope this helpsif the switch is wired to the lamp then there must be a fault on the switch or possibly the wiring if it’s a software connection then there may be other possibilities is it a dumb lamp or a smart oneif i’ve understood the situation correctly the most obvious question is whether the switch is wired correctly is it possible that the switched wire is connected to the live one as far as a dumb lamp is concerned it should act as a hardware switch even if smarththings is switched off as i assume we are talking about a double switch is the symptom the same for both switchesnearly everything i changed from the simic code was specific to the 2 button switch i didn’t have a 1 button switch while i was doing this and it looks like something has made the code fail for the 1 button switch i now have a 1 button switch but haven’t had time to try it out yet i suspect the issue is trivial i will get back to you when i’ve had time to look at itwhen i added the capability of shifting the measured temperature to conform better with expectations i noted that this shift only took effect when the measured temperature changed part of the problem is that the device only gives an integer temperature so there may be a significant lag before that changes the device itself checks in every 5 minutes or so and the dh checks whether the temperature has changed there’s also some doubt as to whether the temperature measured is the temperature of the surroundings or some sort of internal temperaturei’ve now added an updated version to github under https://github.com/aonghus-mor/smartthingspublic/blob/master/devicetypes/aonghus-mor/aqara-wired-wall-switch-no-neutral.src/aqara-wired-wall-switch-no-neutral.groovy this version should work for both the single and double switches note the change of name to reflect this change i will try to arrange the github such that the old name still works but i haven’t worked out how to do that yeti will try to look at that suggestion when i have time i am not familar with the relay controller but i suspect the toggle vs momentary issue is a function fo the dh especiallyif as you say itn works with the xiaomi gateway in the meantime i have the single switch version working with my dhi have now modified my dh to work with the single button switch see message 16 in this threadlook at message 16 on this topic',\n",

at least 1 second 1000 are reliable but only practical when the strobe instead of beep setting is enabled what should the ‘both’ and ‘on’ commands turn on smart home monitor uses the both command so this setting allows you to override the behavior of the both command so that just the siren or strobe is turned on alarm delay in seconds if this is set to something other than 0 when the alarm is turned on it will wait this amount of time before doing anything this sets the default behavior but you can also specify the delay as needed using the custom commands the mobile app will display alarm pending and if the off command is executed before the delay is up the alarm won’t go off the mobile app will display alarm pending and if the off command is executed before the delay is up the alarm won’t go off strobe during alarm delay if this feature is enabled and a delay time has been specified the strobe will stay on during the delay this sets the default behavior but you can also enable this as needed using the custom commands if your delay time exceeds the auto off time the alarm won’t sound the delay time is counted towards the auto off so if you set the delay to 45 seconds and

information after switching to this device handler make sure you go into the device’s settings in the mobile app and complete the configuration when testing disable the auto off feature in the settings and i recommend putting the device under a pillow so you don’t end up going deaf unfortunately the device has a slow response time so the beep feature may work most of the time for some users and rarely work for others i have a feeling that the beep feature is going to be too loud and unreliable for most people to use faqs the setting numbers mentioned in the answers below correspond to the numbers shown in the device’s settings screen why isn’t the tts feature working this device only has the ability to play the one sound it comes with all the speak text and play text commands allow you to do is execute any of the device’s custom commands from any smart app that supports the speech synthesis or music player capabilities i’m using the delayed alarm with strobe feature but the alarm never turns on setting 1 is a hardware setting so the delay time is counted towards the auto off time if you have it set to 30 seconds it will stop strobing after 30 seconds and the siren won’t turn on you should change setting 1 to disable auto off while testing and for normal use set it to the first option that’s higher than the total of the strobe delay and the amount of time you want the siren to stay on for use the custom commands if you want more control over the auto off time example to make the device strobe for 15 seconds and then strobe and siren for 30 seconds change setting 1 to 60 seconds and use the command customsiren15 30 true or for smartapps that don’t support custom commands use the speak or play text command with the message siren 15 30 true why does the device take so long to turn on this device is slow to respond to commands but setting 3 also effects performance when setting 3 is enabled it always sets the alarm type before turning on which causes the strobe to flash once before it turns on when that setting is disabled it first checks to see if it needs to change the setting which eliminates the red flash every time but also makes it take longer to turn on these settings will provide the best performance setting 3 enable setting 8 disable why does the beep command sometimes turn on the siren for 23 seconds instead of beeping the response time of this device is unreliable so there’s no way to prevent this from happening most users probably won’t be able to use the beep functionality because of this problem and how loud the siren is how can i just use the strobe with smart home monitor shm when shm turns on the siren it uses the both command but if you change setting 2 to strobe only it will override the behavior of that command and display the strobe instead how can i use the siren without having it flash any lights if you use the settings below the light may flash the first time you try it but it won’t flash again unless you use the strobe setting 2 siren only settings 3 4 and 5 disabled how can i make the red light stay solid while the siren is on you can’t with the delayed alarm but for a regular alarm use the settings settings 3 and 4 enabled setting 6 0 this feature exploits a bug in the way the device works so it’s not completely reliable the link below will always go to the most recent version of this device

model wa105dbz1 zm1601us3 vision home security model zm1601us5 linearlinc zwave sirenstrobe model 1liwa105dbz2 capabilities alarm tone audio notification switch battery the speech synthesis and music player capabilities can only be used to send specific commands to the device through using any smartapp author this file has been truncated show originaldshokouhi i see speech synthesis added but does this mean the device can do tts or it can just play a preconfigured track the device can’t do tts and there are no tracks most smartapps that use the alarm capability like smart home monitor call the both command instead of giving you the option to use just the siren or strobe you can override the default behavior in the dh settings but that prevents you from using the siren and strobe in one situation and just the strobe or siren in another i haven’t seen any smartapps that support the tone capability so there’s no easy way to use the beep functionality to get around those limitations the music player and speech synthesis capabilities allow you to execute commands like siren strobe both beep etc as custom text i know the first post is really long but it explains how you can use those capabilities with shm notify with sound and rule machine update it looks like out of the 3 smartapps i mentioned rule machine is the only one that supports the speech synthesis capability so you have to use the music player capability for the othersi just released a new version that fixes some minor ui issues and improves the logging and reliability but it doesn’t have any additional features you can find the latest version in the top postsince the last performance improvement smartthings made i’ve been seeing over 90 reliability of the beep feature but results will most likely vary depending on the time of daytommyincville i seems to be getting different results every other testany ideas if you were previous using a different device handler you need to go into the settings and save which dh were you previously using if you had already done that what are you using for the settings automatically turn off after length of beep strobe instead of beep bothon behavior always use bothon behavior what are you seeing in live loggingi thought i should explain the limitations of the device how the settings attempt to work around those limitations and the pros and cons of using those workarounds auto off feature the device has an optional builtin feature that automatically turns the device off after 30 seconds 60 seconds or 120 seconds if you have the automatically turn off after option set to one of those values the alarm will turn off after that amount of time regardless of st having major performance issues or your internetpower going down while the siren is on since the device has no off button and you can’t quickly get at and take out the batteries it’s probably a good idea to have this feature enabled for normal use it’s important to turn this feature off while testing because the time doesn’t get extended every time the device is turned on for example if you have it set to turn off after 30 seconds and you manually turn it on and then off 1 second later the physical device will automatically turn off 29 seconds later even if you started another test since you manually turned it off that’s not a problem for the first test but if you happened to start the second test about 30 seconds after starting the first test the device turning off from the first test will probably prevent the second test from doing anything or it will turn off almost immediately after turning on default behavior siren strobe or siren strobe the device allows you to specify what happens when the device is turned on but when you change that value the strobe flashes at least once to confirm the change the dh could check to see what the device is currently set to but that would require it to send a command wait for the response and if it isn’t set to the correct value it would have to send another command to change it so instead of doing that the dh always changes that setting before turning the device on turning the device on too soon after changing the setting to siren causes the red light to stay on solid until the siren turns off which is why there’s a pause between the confirmation flash and the device turning on if you only plan on using the device for one action enabling the always use bothon setting prevents it from changing the setting first so you won’t have the confirmation flash or the long pause before it turns on when that option is enabled the action specified in the what should the ‘both’ and ‘on’ commands turn on option will be performed regardless of which test button you press if you want the option to use them independently but you use the same action most of the time checking the current setting instead of automatically changing it would be beneficial so i may add that as an optional setting in a future version beep feature the device doesn’t support beepingchirping so to provide that functionality the dh turns the device on waits the amount of time specified in the length of beep option and then turns the device off due to st latency a beep length of 0 ms usually sounds the same as a beep length of 100ms and sometimes the siren actually stays on for a couple of seconds since the platform changes st made a couple of days ago that’s only been happening about 5 of the time when the strobe instead of beep option is enabled the always use bothon setting option is ignored because it needs to be able to change the default behavior in order to ensure that it doesn’t make a sound if you’re experiencing strange behavior enable the enable debug logging option and look at live logging because it will output the action being performed and it always outputs the reason if a setting is overriding the normal functionality battery status most battery operated devices go to sleep and wake up at regular intervals so you can check the battery status since this device needs to be able to receive commands at all times the device specs don’t mention that feature and i haven’t seen any wake up events yet i’m pretty sure this device doesn’t provide that functionality not having that functionality will prevent the battery status from getting updated at regular intervals so i’ve added the poll capability based on the st documention the poll method should be called every 10 minutes but if st calls it at all it’s usually only called every couple of days if you want it to check the battery more frequently you could use a smartapp like pollster or the simple device viewer smartapp i haven’t updated the documentation for that smartapp yet but there’s an option in the other settings section that allows you to enable polling possible future features i’m almost certain st would reject this dh if i submitted it for publication because of the improper use of the music playerspeech capabilities and also the reliability of the beep feature because of that and since i really don’t need the features below because i’ve already implemented them in my aeon labs siren dh i’m not going to waste time implementing them unless they’re something users want and the dh becomes popular delayed alarm allows you to specify an amount of time to wait before turning on alarm executing the off command before it turns on will cancel the delayed alarm strobe delayed alarm strobes for a specified amount of time and then turns on the siren executing the off command will turn off the strobe and prevent the siren from soundingesteban1193 can you please help me to install the siren if you’ve installed and published the device handler and this is a new device it should automatically detect the device handler as long

feature no longer works with shm or speaker notify with sound because they broke the custom message functionality in those smartapps you can still use the device as an alarm or switch in those smartapps but if you want to be able to use features like beep you will need to use a community developed smartapp like either rule machine or core the developer of rule machine doesn’t allow new installs so unless you already had it installed you will have to use core insteadkrlaframboise the custom command feature no longer works with shm or speaker notify with sound because they broke the

the home depot clearance i ended up getting 3 more of these sirens so i will be adding some new functionality to this dth soon i will definitely be adding the delayedalarm and strobedelayedalarm commands i’m considering adding intermittentalarm which would basically turn on and off the alarm for a specified amount of time and the on time and off time would be customizable i’ve found the beep feature to be too unpredictable and loud to be of any use i won’t remove the existing beep feature but i won’t be adding the beepdelayedalarm or scheduledbeep commands that my aeon siren dth has i’m

it will fetch the latest sensor status temperature battery and also update the inactivity timeout configuration to force an immediate update for all configured settings press the request update button

just open the cover wait for 15 seconds and close the cover monoprice jumper pins on this device you will see a few jumper pins labelled pet1 and pet2 these behave differently from the ecolink motion sensor jumpers when using pet1 pet2 and test modes it reduces the distance at which it picks up motion correspondinglyquoting the manufacturer depending on the settings it will change the distance of motion detection specifically pet1 does 8m11m pet2 does 5m7m and test does 3m4m note this is different from the motion sensitivity option for the newer zwave plus devices which determine the level of motion within the range that must be detected to trigger a motion event low battery if your battery falls below 35 consider replacing it the device will stop sending updates if the battery falls below this level so you won’t know if you battery has run out the motionno motion sensors temperature sensor may get stuck as well and you may receive no updates temperature updates for the older zwave devices according to the documentation every rise or drop of 2 degrees will trigger a notification to the hub if you aren’t seeing too many temperature updates it’s likely that your room temperature isn’t changing much so the device will send fewerno temperature updates according to the technical team the temperature updates are sent every 10 minutes if there is a change of atleast 2 degrees for the newer zwave plus devices the device supports two options 1 degree or 2 degree threshold to trigger a temperature reporting update this device handler automatically sets the reporting threshold to 1 degree when the request update button is pressed make sure you open the device cover wait for 15 seconds and close the cover for it to take effect more features to added if you have any suggestions

doesn’t work i suspect it may be a faulty deviceone more point to check make sure the inactivity timeout is not zero if it’s zero that means it will never send an inactive notification just to be sure

itthanks fixed it can you try version 102 also see if it fixes the motion not turning off issue possible that the bug was interrupting the flowplease update to v102 and try this rboy one more point to check make sure the inactivity timeout is not zero if its zero that means it will never send an inactive notification just to be sure do this open the device preferences set the timeout to 1 minute

note after the configurationpreferences are updated for the settings to take effect immediate press the zwave button with a pin tiny hole at the bottom of of the sensor to request the manual update please press the request update button however this is a delayed update the motion sensor is mostly in sleep mode to preserve battery the next time it wakes up every 4 hours or as configured if the user had requested a manual update it will fetch the latest sensor status battery and also update the configuration to force an immediate update for all configured settings press the request update button and then press the zwave button with a pin tiny hole at the bottom of of the sensor this forces the motion sensor to wake up and process the manual update request to force a sensorbattery status update just press the zwave button with a pin tiny hole at the bottom of of the sensor optimizing battery life these units use alkaline batteries by default and which tend to have a lower voltage than lithium batteries hence the battery tends to drop faster initially it’s normal for the battery to go from 100 to 90 in a day due to the voltage discharge curve of alkaline batteries these units function all the way down to 15 or lower overall battery life from 100 to 15 should be between 39 months with standard alkaline batteries rechargeable batteries should not be used as the voltage isn’t high enough and the voltage curve drops very quickly best would be to use 15v lithium batteries non rechargeable which can double or triple the life before you need to replace batteries and provide a more stable voltage discharge curves whether the life is 3 or 9 months depends up on your settings and usage if you set the sensitivity of humidity temperature motion and light very high the battery will drain quickly because you’re essentially asking the sensor to pretty much continuously send updates what i would recommend is to identify how sensitive do you need each sensor and then set the sensitivity accordingly eg for humidity you want to know if there a 5 or 10 change where as for light you only care about dark or light so set that at 50 for temperature you don’t care so set it to the least sensitive for motion similarly set the timeout and sensitivity optimizing this can make a huge difference in your battery life finally set the led mode to off or quick flash setting avoid using the breathing mode as it’ll drain your battery low battery if your battery below 20 consider replacing it the device may stop sending updates if the battery falls below this level so you won’t know if you battery has run out the motionno motion sensors temperature sensor may get stuck as well and you may receive no updates more features to added if you have any suggestions or ideas please feel free to ask and we’ll try to add it inclusion instructions it is recommended to install the device handler before paring the device for easier setup if you are unsure about the device
